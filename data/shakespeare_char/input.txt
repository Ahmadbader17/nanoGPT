EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:
CHAPTER ONE
“ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .
NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE”
This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:
“1941
One year into the German
occupation of France”
The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings
an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property.
However, simply by sight, you’d never know if he’s been beating at
this stump for the last year or just started today.
JULIE
one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on
the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a
noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:
JULIE’S POV
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in
the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles,
coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.
JULIE
Pappa.
The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his
shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.
The FARMER’S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans
approaching.
The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.
FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash
up with, then get inside with your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out,
splashing into the basin.
The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his
face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a
year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the
windowsill.
JULIE
Ready, Pappa.
FARMER
Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care
of your mother. Don’t run.
Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the
windowsill with the water basin . . .
. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get
LOUDER.
The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don’t move into them but keep observing them from a distance,
like the farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the
door for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:
NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?
NAZI DRIVER
Yes, Herr Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle,
carrying in his left hand a black leather attaché case.
NAZI OFFICER
Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left
alone.
NAZI DRIVER
As you wish, Herr Colonel.
The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH:
NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long
strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:
NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur
LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his
hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.
PERRIER
How may I help you?
COL. LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside your
home and we may have a discussion.
INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY
The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for
the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German
steps inside the Frenchman’s home.
Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer’s
wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen,
smiling in his direction.
The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.
PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of
the French farmer’s wife . . .
COL. LANDA
Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his
hostess’s hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.
FARMER’S WIFE
Don’t be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.
While still holding the French woman’s hand and looking into her
eyes, the S.S. colonel says:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in
the village about your family are all true.
Your wife is a beautiful woman.
His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And each of your daughters is more lovely than
the last.
PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family’s wooden
dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer’s offer
and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the
table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet.
The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:
PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the
Colonel some wine?
COL. LANDA
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in
assuming you have milk?
CHARLOTTE
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.
CHARLOTTE
Very well.
The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.
The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it
down LOUDLY on the wooden table.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I
say: Bravo.
PERRIER
Merci.
COL. LANDA
Please, join me at your table.
PERRIER
Very well.
The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from
the Nazi.
The women remain standing.
Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of
confidentiality:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private. You’ll
notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn’t
offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies
to step outside?
PERRIER
You are right.
PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
The farmer’s wife follows her husband’s orders and gathers her
daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The two men are alone at the farmer’s dinner table, in the farmer’s
humble home.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I’ve
exhausted the extent of my French. To continue
to speak it so inadequately would only serve to
embarrass me. However, I’ve been led
to believe you speak English quite well?
PERRIER
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This
being your house, I ask your permission to
switch to English for the remainder of the
conversation.
PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very familiar with
you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar
with who I am. Are you aware
of my existence?
The farmer answers:
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job I’ve
been ordered to carry out in France?
PERRIER
Yes.
The colonel drinks more milk.
COL. LANDA
Please tell me what you’ve heard?
PERRIER
I’ve heard the Führer has put you in charge of
rounding up the Jews left in France who are
either hiding or passing for gentile.
The S.S. colonel smiles.
COL. LANDA
The Führer couldn’t have said it better
himself.
PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though
it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months
ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
COL. LANDA
I’m aware of that. I read the report on this
area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there’s always a
slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being
a complete waste of time, but it needs to be
done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my
department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attaché case and placing it on the table,
he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive
black fountain pen from his uniform’s front pocket. Opening the
folder and referring to it:
COL. LANDA
Now, before the occupation there were four
Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers
like yourself:
the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins,
and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?
PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers:
COL. LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.
Make yourself comfortable.
The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the
fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
guest.
As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S.
colonel studies the papers in front of him.
COL. LANDA
Now, according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have been
accounted for—except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in
the last year it would appear they have
vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve
either made good their escape
or someone is very successful hiding them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at the
farmer)
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses,
Monsieur LaPadite?
PERRIER
Only rumors—
COL. LANDA
—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where
rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So,
Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard
regarding
the Dreyfuses?
The farmer looks at Landa.
COL. LANDA
Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear
what the rumors are, not who told them to you.
The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.
PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor—but we
heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into
Spain.
COL. LANDA
So the rumors you’ve heard have been of escape?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?
As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards, revealing:
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying horizontally underneath the farmer’s floorboards. These human
beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the
dairy farmer’s house for the past year. But one couldn’t call what
the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has
done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that
wishes to exterminate them.
PERRIER
We were families in the same community, in the
same business. I wouldn’t say
we were friends, but members of the same
community. We had common interests.
The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then
moves to the next question.
COL. LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you
confirm for me the exact members of the
household and their names?
PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her
brother, Bob . . .
COL. LANDA
—How old is Bob?
PERRIER
Thirty—thirty-one?
COL. LANDA
Continue.
PERRIER
And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Ages of the children?
PERRIER
Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna
was fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.
CUT TO
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off
the clothesline.
They can’t hear anything going on inside.
The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.
BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER
COL. LANDA
Well, I guess that should do it.
He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his
attaché case.
The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
COL. LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another glass
of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
But of course.
The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the
carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel’s
glass, the German officer talks.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given me?
PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.
COL. LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?
PERRIER
I’m aware.
COL. LANDA
What are you aware of?
PERRIER
That they call you “the Jew Hunter.”
COL. LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in
repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good people of
Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would
hate the name “the Hangman” is baffling to me.
It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title, precisely because
I’ve earned it.
As “the Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
with the French farmer.
COL. LANDA
The feature that makes me such an effective
hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German
soldiers, I can think like a Jew, where they can
only think like a German or, more precisely, a
German soldier.
Now if one were to determine what attribute the
German people share with a beast, it would be the
cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical
strength—penis size.
But if one were to determine what attributes
the Jews share with a beast, it would
be that of the rat.
Now the Führer and Goebbels’s propaganda have
said pretty much the same thing. Where our
conclusions differ is I don’t consider the
comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the
world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world
indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now, would you greet it with
hostility?
PERRIER
I suppose I would.
COL. LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create
this animosity you feel toward them?
PERRIER
Rats spread disease, they bite people—
COL. LANDA
Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a
practice of biting human beings. Rats were the
cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some
time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever
caused you to be sick a day in your life? I
propose to you, any disease a rat could spread
a squirrel would equally carry.
Yet I assume you don’t share the same animosity
with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
PERRIER
No.
COL. LANDA
Yet they are both rodents, are they
not? And except for the fact that one has a big
bushy tail, while the other has a long
repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather
look alike, don’t they?
PERRIER
It is an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.
COL. LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may be, it
makes not one bit of difference to how you
feel. If a rat were to scamper through your
door this very minute, would you offer it a
saucer of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
Probably not.
COL. LANDA
I didn’t think so. You don’t like them. You
don’t really know why you don’t like them. All
you know is, you find them repulsive.
(lets the
metaphor
sink in)
What a tremendously hostile world a rat must
endure. Yet not only does he survive, he
thrives. And the reason for this is because our
little foe has an instinct for survival and
preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur,
is what a Jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he
would hide. But there are many places it would
never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the
reason the Führer brought me off my Alps in
Austria and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.
Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
(changing tone)
May I smoke my pipe as well?
The farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.
PERRIER
Please, colonel, make yourself at home.
The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped
gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues
to hold court at the Frenchman’s table.
COL. LANDA
The other mistake the German soldiers
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing.
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in wartime.
Let’s use you as a example, Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet
here you are.
So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose
a question. In this time of war, what is
your number-one duty? Is it to fight
the Germans in the name of France to your
last breath? Or is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate
victims of warfare who can
not protect themselves?
Or is your number-one duty in this time
of bloodshed to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
COL. LANDA
That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this
time of war, what do you consider your numberone
duty?
PERRIER
To protect my family.
COL. LANDA
Now, my job dictates that I must have
my men enter your home and conduct a thorough
search before I can officially cross your
family’s name off my list.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And if there are any irregularities to be
found, rest assured, they will be.
That is, unless you have something to tell me
that will make the conducting of a search
unnecessary.
(pause)
I might add also that any information
that makes the performing of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be your family
will cease to be harassed in any way
by the German military during the rest of our
occupation of your country.
The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
opponent.
COL. LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state, are
you not?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
You’re sheltering them underneath your
floorboards, aren’t you?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Point out to me the areas where they’re hiding.
The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses
are underneath.
COL. LANDA
Since I haven’t heard any disturbance,
I assume that while they’re listening, they
don’t speak English?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
I’m going to switch back to French now, and I
want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?
PERRIER
Yes.
Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,
SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and
your hospitality. I do believe our business here
is done.
The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his
men to approach the house.
COL. LANDA
Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We
shan’t be bothering your family any longer.
The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the
area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.
COL. LANDA
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,
I bid you adieu.
He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.
They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS,
SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.
With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their
gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate
silence.
UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS
The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old
SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis’
bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes
for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).
COL. LANDA
hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE
moving forward between the planks in the floor.
COL. LANDA
It’s the girl. Nobody move!
VENT
is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.
COL. LANDA
as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the
cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna
is perfectly FRAMED in the windowsill.
SHOSANNA

COL. LANDA
changes his mind. He yells to the rat fleeing the trap, heading for
the safety of the woodpile, in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Au revoir, Shosanna!
SHOSANNA
makes it to the woods and is gone.
The S.S. colonel closes the window.
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The Nazi town car DRIVES away.
EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY
Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that’s
speeding away from the French farmhouse.
Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?
Out with it?
DRIVER
Why did you allow an enemy of the state to
escape?
COL. LANDA
Oh, I don’t think the state is in too much
danger, do you?
DRIVER
I suppose not.
COL. LANDA
I’m glad you see it my way. Besides,
not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteenyear-
old girl and allowing
her to escape are not necessarily
the same thing. She’s a young girl, no food, no
shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the
massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after
word spreads about what happened today, it’s
highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers
to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I’d say she’ll
probably be turned in by some neighbor.
Or she’ll be spotted by some German soldier. Or
we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from
starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she’ll
survive. She will elude capture. She will escape
to America. She will move to New York City,
where she will be elected President of
the United States.
The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.
FADE UP
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER TWO
“INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS”
FADE UP
EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY
A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee,
walks down the line. He recruits the men the
Germans will later call “The Basterds.” Lt. Aldo has one
defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his
neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.
The scar will never once be mentioned.
LT. ALDO
My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin’
together a special team.
And I need me eight soldiers.
Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers.
Now y’all might of heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.
Well, we’ll be leavin’ a little
earlier. We’re gonna be dropped
into France, dressed as civilians.
And once we’re in enemy territory, as
a bushwackin’, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be
doin’ one thing, and one thing only—Killin’
Nazis.
The members of the National Socialist Party
have conquered Europe through murder, torture,
intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly
what we’re gonna do to them. Now I don’t know
’bout y’all? But I sure as hell didn’t come
down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross
five thousand miles
of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and
then jump out of a fuckin’ air-o-plane to teach
the Nazis
lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got
no humanity. They’re the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hatin’, mass-murderin’ maniac, and they
need to be destroyed.
That’s why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find
wearin’ a Nazi uniform, they’re gonna die.
LT. ALDO
(CON’T)
We will be cruel to the Germans,
and through our cruelty, they will
know who we are. They will find the evidence of
our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered,
and
disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us. And the Germans
will not be able to help themselves
from imagining the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands, and
our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.
And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the
Germans will talk about us.
And the Germans will fear us.
And when the Germans close their eyes at night
and their subconscious
tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it
will be thoughts of us
that it tortures them with.
He stops pacing and looks at everybody.
LT. ALDO
Sound good?
They all say:
ALL
Yes, sir!
LT. ALDO
That’s what I like to hear. But I
got a word of warning to all would-be warriors.
When you join my command,
you take on debit. A debit you owe
me, personally. Every man under my command owes
me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my
scalps.
And all y’all will git me one hundred
Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of
one hundred dead Nazis . . .
or you will die trying.

A huge chalet on a misty mountaintop in Bavaria.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“BAVARIA
BERCHTESGADEN
(HITLER’S PRIVATE LAIR)”
INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY
In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with
his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.
They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
HITLER
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure? They butcher my men
like they were fish bait! This pack
of filthy degenerates are doing what
the Russian army didn’t and Patton’s army
couldn’t—turning soldiers of
the Third Reich into superstitious
old women!
GERMAN GENERAL
Just the cowards among them, mein Führer.
Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.
HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich,
who have brought the world to their knees, now
pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know
the latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their
fear-induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call “the Bear
Jew” . . . is a golem.
An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!
GENERAL
Mein Führer, this is just soldiers’ gossip. No
one really believes the
Bear Jew is a golem.
HITLER
Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at
will.
HITLER
(CON’T)
You want to prove they’re flesh and blood? Then
BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their
heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in
the sewers, for the rats of Paris
to feast!
The Führer sits down at the table to compose himself and
wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.
HITLER
(disgusted)
The Bear Jew.
He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.
HITLER
Kliest!
KLIEST’S VOICE comes out of the intercom:
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
I have an order I want relayed to all German
soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as the Bear
Jew henceforth is never to be
referred to as the Bear Jew again.
We will cease to aid the Americans
any longer in their attempt to
undermine the German soldier’s psyche. Did you
get that, Kliest?
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer. Do you still wish
to see Private Butz?
HITLER
Who and what is a private Butz?
KLEIST’S VOICE (OS)
He’s the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine’s Jews. He was its only survivor.
HITLER
Indeed I do want to see him. Thank
you for reminding me. Send him in.
CUT TO
EXT—FRENCH WOODS—DAY
CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER
His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into
the FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriot’s helmet, and grabs
a handful of the cadaver’s blond hair. A LARGE KNIFE
ENTERS THE FRAME and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a
banana skin.
GERMAN PRISONERS PVT. BUTZ AND SGT. RACHTMAN
on their knees, hand behind their heads.
Pvt. Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH:
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
Werner and I were the only ones left alive
after the ambush. While one man guarded us, the
rest removed the hair. All the Basterds wore
German scalps
tied to their belts.
CU SCALPS
hanging from belts.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
They not only took valuables . . .
WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF
rings, weapons, an iron cross, and somebody digging out a gold
tooth with a knife, being removed from dead Germans.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
. . . They also took their identification
papers . . .
CU IDENTIFICATION PAPERS
taken from the inside pocket of a dead German’s uniform.
BASTERD PFC. UTIVICH
flips through the I.D. papers till he gets to the page that
contains the German soldier’s name, statistics, and photo.
PFC. UTIVICH
Sigfried Muller.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
. . . They then removed their boots . . .
CU GERMAN COMBAT BOOTS
laces untied . . . boots pulled off . . .
SOCKS
removed, revealing dead bare feet . . .
BASTERDS
tossing the boots off a hill.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
Throwing them away from the bodies . . .
DEAD GERMANS
scalps removed from their heads, pink bare feet . . .
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
The Basterds took their lives, their hair,
their valuables, their identity, and finally
their dignity in death.
True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
does rob the tableau of a certain dignity that is normally
felt in battlefield shots.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
The dogs!
He fights his frustration, then . . .
HITLER
Continue.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Aldo screams to the Basterd who’s guarding the two German
prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut
sarge over.
BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG
KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
You! Go!
Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,
An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he’s ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It’s always been his belief that
only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit
complies with the enemy under threat of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict,
when they put him under the earth,
his dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well, Sergeant, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands
straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his
captor.
SGT. RACHTMAN
(ENGLISH)
Sgt. Werner Rachtman.
Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.
LT. ALDO
Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.
You know what sit down means, Werner?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Then sit down.
The German sergeant does.
LT. ALDO
How’s your English, Werner? Cause if need be,
we gotta couple fellas
can translate.
Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle,
CPL. WILHELM WICKI.
LT. ALDO
Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck
outta Salzberg while the
gettin’ was good. Became American,
got drafted, and came back to give
y’all what for.
Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd,
in a German sergeant’s uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.
LT. ALDO
And another one over there you
might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of ’em?
The two German sergeants look at each other.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Everybody in the German army’s heard
of Hugo Stiglitz.
The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.
NARRATOR (VO)
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s
celebrity among German soldiers
is simple.
WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).
NARRATOR (VO)
As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen
Gestapo officers, mostly
majors.
WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.
NARRATOR (VO)
Instead of putting him up against
a wall, the High Command decided to
send him back to Berlin, to be made
an example of.
Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
prison convoy, en route to Berlin.
NARRATOR (VO)
Needless to say, once the Basterds
heard about him, he never got there.
EXT—FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE—DAY
The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
They walk to the back of the troop truck. Inside, Hugo, in chains,
stares back at them.
LT. ALDO
Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz?
Hugo nods.
LT. ALDO
I’m Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are
the Basterds. Ever heard of us?
Hugo nods his head, yes.
LT. ALDO
We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your
work. When it comes to killin’ Nazis, I think
you show great talent, and I pride myself on
havin’ an eye for that kind of talent. But your
status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We
all came here to see if you wanna go pro?
BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.
LT. ALDO
Now Werner, I’m gonna assume you know who we
are?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Aldo the Apache.
The circle of Basterds giggle.
LT. ADLO
Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably
heard we ain’t in the
prisoner-takin’ business. We in the killin’
Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin’.
The Basterds laugh.
LT. ALDO
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill ya or let ya
go. Now whether or not you gonna
leave this circle alive depends
entirely on you.
Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front
of his prisoner.
LT. ALDO
Up the road a piece, there’s a
orchard. ’Sides you, we know there’s another
kraut patrol fuckin’ around
here somewhere. Now if that patrol
were to have any crack shots, that orchard
would be a goddamn sniper’s delight. Now if you
ever wanna eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
gotta show me on this map where
they are, you gotta tell me how many they are,
and you gotta tell me
what kinda artillery they carrying
with ’em.
SGT. RACHTMAN
You can’t expect me to divulge information that
would put German
lives in danger.
LT. ALDO
Well, Werner, that’s where you’re wrong.
Because that’s exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hidin’
in trees. And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me, right now.
Now take your finger and point out
on this map where this party’s bein’ held, how
many’s comin’, and what they brought to play
with.
Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
inch the German hero facing death.
SGT. WERNER
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.
LT. ALDO
You see that ole boy battin’ rocks?
WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle.
He’s wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones
with a baseball bat.
Werner’s eyes go to the ballplayer.
LT. ALDO
That’s Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know
him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now
if you heard of
Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear
Jew?
SGT. RACHTMAN
I heard.
LT. ALDO
What did you hear?
SGT. RACHTMAN
He beats German soldiers with a club.
LT. ALDO
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat,
what he does.
SGT. DONOWITZ
back to us, still haven’t seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
rock soaring into the atmosphere.
LT. ALDO
Now, Werner, I’m gonna ask you one
last goddamn time, and if you still
“respectfully refuse,” I’m calling the Bear Jew
over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of
his, and he’s gonna beat your ass to death with
it.
Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin’ finger
and point out on this map
what I want to know.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Fuck you and your Jew dogs.
Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.
Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:
LT. ALDO
Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled
ya said that. Frankly, watchin’ Donny beat
Nazis to death is the closest
we ever get to goin’ to the movies.
(YELLING)
DONNY!
SGT. DONOWITZ
He turns to the CAMERA and yells:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Yeah?
LT. ALDO
Got a German here wants to die for his country.
Oblige him.
SGT. DONNY DONOWITZ
bat over his shoulder, smiles.
CUT TO
INT—BARBER SHOP (BOSTON)—DAY
Donny, cutting heads, in his pop’s barber shop, in Boston.
DONNY
. . . ya got the goddamn, fuckin’ Germans,
declaring open season on Jews in
Europe, and I’m suppose to fly to the fuckin’
Philippines and fight a bunch
of fuckin’ Japs—not me, pal.
If we just go in this against the Japs,
the whole U.S. of fuckin A can go take a
running jump at the moon.
HEAD
You know, they got a word for what you’re
sayin’ Donny. It’s called treason.
DONNY
Hey, stick your treason up your poop hole. If
I’m gonna kill my fellow man
in the name of liberty, that fellow
man will be German.
INT—SPORTING GOODS STORE—DAY
MR. GOOROWITZ’S sporting goods shop in Donny’s Jewish Boston
neighborhood. Donny walks in.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Hello, Donny. How are you?
DONNY
Ah, just dandy, Mr. Goorowitz.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Your mother, your father—everything
good there?
DONNY
They’re just fine. I’m shippin’ off next week.
The store proprietor extends his hand to the young man.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Good for you, son. Kill one of those Nazi
basterds for me, will ya?
DONNY
That the idea, Mr. Goorowitz.
MR. GOOROWITZ
What can I do you for, Donny?
DONNY
I need a baseball bat.
The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats in it. Donny
starts going through them without saying anything.
Mr. Goorowitz watches.
MR. GOOROWITZ
You gettin’ your little brother a present
before you ship out?
Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:
DONNY
No.
Donny’s “no” silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.
DONNY
Can I try this one on for size, outside?
Extending his arm:
MR. GOOROWITZ
Be my guest.
The phone rings.
MR. GOOROWITZ
I’ll get that. You go right ahead.
The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a
conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.
Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him
clearly through the store’s big picture window.
However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny
to speak with his mother.
Donny starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming
beating somebody to death with it. Then
he starts yelling:
DONNY
Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like
fuckin’ with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews?
The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !
Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his
mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into
the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.
DONNY
Is this the heaviest ya got?
CUT TO
INT—HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING—DAY
Donny, dressed nice, in an apartment building in his Jewish Boston
neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
peering out at the young man.
OLD WOMAN
How can I help you?
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
State your business, young man.
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz.
My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on
Greeny Ave. Sy’s Barber Shop.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I’ve seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?
DONNY
All my life.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Again, state your business?
DONNY
May I have a word with you?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What about?
DONNY
Our people in Europe.
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
young man.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Come in. Would you like some tea?
INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN’S APARTMENT—DAY
Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair,
holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.
DONNY
(sipping tea)
Very good.
MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN
If you like tea.
Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
stone. She wasn’t joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table
and begins:
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones
over in Europe who you’re concerned for?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger
such a personal question?
DONNY
Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna make
it right.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?
He holds up his bat.
DONNY
With this.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And what exactly do you intend to do with that
toy?
DONNY
I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to
death with it.
She takes another sip of tea.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I thought we were having tea together.
Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of
service?
DONNY
I’m going through the neighborhood.
If you have any loved ones in Europe whose
safety you fear for, I’d like
you to write their name on my bat.
BACK TO BASTERDS
Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .
PVT. BUTZ
watches all this . . .
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING,
WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real basterd, Donny.
DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will
join you on this journey.
She signs the BAT: “MADELEINE.”
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:
He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt’s right pocket.
The Jew taps the German’s medal with the end of his bat.
DONNY
You get that for killing jews?
SGT RACHTMAN
Bravery.
Donny gives him a “oh yeah, we’ll see about that,” look.
The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it
down hard against the side of Rachtman’s head.
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
the Basterds.
PVT. BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him:
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
About now, I’d be shittin’ my pants, if I was
you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.
A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.
LT. ALDO
You wanna live?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, sir.
LT. ALDO
Point out on this map the German position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.
PVT. BUTZ
This area here.
LT. ALDO
How many?
PVT. BUTZ
Maybe twelve.
LT. ALDO
What kind of artillery?
PVT BUTZ
They have a machine gun dug in here pointing
north.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
How did you survive this ordeal?
WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Führer’s room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the
Führer, but he seems okay with it.
PVT. BUTZ
They let me go.
FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.
LT. ALDO
Now, when you report what happened here,
you can’t tell ’em you told us what you
told us. They’ll shoot ya. But they’re gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell ’em we let ya live so you
could spread the word through the ranks
what’s gonna happen to every Nazi we find.
HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one
word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got away.
Not one more word.
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
Pause.
HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the other
survivors?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.
LT. ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the
war? When you get back
home, what ’cha gonna do?
PVT. BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I’ve never hugged her
before.
LT. ALDO
Well, ain’t that a real nice boy. Are you going
to take off your uniform?
PVT. BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to
burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants
to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he
thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t like
that. You see, we like our Nazis
in uniforms. That way, you can spot ’em just
like that.
(snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody
gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don’t sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin’ you
can’t take off.
BACK TO HITLER
Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He
moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HANDCARVED
INTO HIS FOREHEAD.
BACK TO BASTERDS
BUTZ’S POV
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All the
Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.
SGT. DONOWITZ
You know, Lieutenant, you’re getting pretty
good at that.
LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t
cha? Practice.
FADE TO BLACK

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER THREE
“GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS”
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
We’re in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen.
We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from
the little glass window in the back of the theater.
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and
wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens
of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.
We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German
omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.
The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German
dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .
UNTIL . . .
The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the
movie.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“SHOSANNA DREYFUS
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE
OF SHOSANNA’S FAMILY”
We hear the sound of the German musical’s climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE’S UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their
coats and file out.
EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS
OFF the marquee’s lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO.”
EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema’s projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the
film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.
INT—AUDITORIUM
CU SHOSANNA
Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.
The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman,
who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
one of the cinema’s opera-box balconies.
Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in
the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So, young woman, since it’s beyond obvious we’re
closed for the evening, I must assume you want
something. What can I do for you?
SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?
MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather you’re not a nurse?
SHOSANNA
No.
MADAME MIMIEUX
But you’re a bright little thing. That’s a
clever disguise. Where is your family?
SHOSANNA
Murdered.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you’re a war orphan?
SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—
MADAME MIMIEUX
—Is this a sad story?
SHOSANNA.
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in
Paris has one. I haven’t bored you with mine.
Don’t bore me with yours.
SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?
MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
projector, she says:
SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film.
MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.
Of course I can operate them.
SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.
FLASH ON:
CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
watching . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors . . .
BACK TO SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that
show the film. It’s only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who’ve been put up
against a wall and machinegunned
for sheltering enemies of the state. I
have no intention of being unlucky number
seven. How long have
you been in Paris?
SHOSANNA
A week and a few days.
MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?
SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I’m forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?
SHOSANNA
Cold.
MADAME MIMIEUX
(laughs)
I can imagine.
SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can’t.
Pause.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.
Thinks . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can’t operate a 35mm film projector. You
want me to teach you, in order to work here, in
order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is
that correct?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
What’s your name?
SHOSANNA
Shosanna.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.
DISSOLVE TO
TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
complete with Eiffel Tower.
ABOVE IT READS:
“1944
PARIS”
THEN . . .
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not looking at a TITLE CARD
at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema’s
projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
month is JUNE . . .
The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed
Madame Mimieux’s exceptional test.
A lyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This
will be “Shosanna’s Theme.”
A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors,
alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
she’s projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .
SILVER SCREEN
of the little cinema. Onscreen LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies
horizontal as an icicle drips on her head in the old
German film “The White Hell of Pitz Palu.”
The FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-righthand
corner of the FRAME (that tells the projectionist
to get ready).
As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands
ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .
WHEN . . .
SILVER SCREEN
the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that’s the
one).
SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from
projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As “Shosanna’s Theme” plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via
MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans
up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST’S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU”
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices. Either you
could show new German propaganda films, produced
under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks
out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
girl on top and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at
her from below.
SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a
film as good as “The Kid.” The chase climax of
“The Kid,” superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use an M,
an A, and an X?
SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .
GERMAN SOLDIER
Is it yours?
SHOSANNA
Do I own it?
GERMAN SOLDIER
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl such as yourself own a
cinema?
Due to his uniform and Shosanna’s situation, his efforts
at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.
SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hosting a German night.
SHOSANNA
I don’t have a choice, but you’re welcome.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you choose the German films yourself?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl
mountain films, especially “Pitz Palu.” It’s
nice to see a French girl who’s an admirer of
Riefenstahl.
SHOSANNA
“Admire” would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings toward
Fräulein Riefenstahl.
GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director Pabst, don’t
you? That’s why you included
his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
private.
SHOSANNA
I’m French. We respect directors
in our country.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.
SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
You’re not finished?
SHOSANNA
I’ll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?
SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That’s obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
to read her name.
COL. LANDA
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very
pretty name.
SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.
She gives no response.
GERMAN SOLDIER
It’s been a pleasure chatting with a fellow
cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfewimposed
night.
She looks after him. She didn’t show it, but he kind of got to her.
After all, for any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody
who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.
EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting
up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.
FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist,
Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.
MADAME MIMIEUX
If I ever see you light up a cigarette in my
cinema again, I’ll turn you in to the Nazis, do
you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing an open flame into my cinema,
you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish
boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think
the highest priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning down to
the ground, that’s what!
In my collection, I have over three hundred and
fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not
only immensely flammable but highy unstable.
And should they catch fire, they burn three
times faster than paper. If that happens . . .
POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody
burned alive. If I ever
see you with an open flame in my cinema again,
I won’t turn you into the Nazis. I’ll kill you
myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a
curfew pass.
Do you understand me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.
BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.
MARCEL
Are you well?
SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette
without hearing Madame’s
voice yelling at me. That’s why I
do it. To hear Madame’s voice again.
MARCEL
We both miss her.
SHOSANNA
I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.
INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, “The Saint in New York,” by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine when the young German soldier from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French
girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over
to her. “Oh no, not this guy again,” she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
May I join you?
SHOSANNA
Look, Fredrick—
FREDRICK
(smiling)
—You remember my name?
SHOSANNA
Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow—
FREDRICK
—Merci.
SHOSANNA
You’re welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop
pestering me.
FREDRICK
I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn’t trying to
be a pest. I was simply
trying to be friendly.
SHOSANNA
I don’t wish to be your friend.
FREDRICK
Why not?
SHOSANNA
Don’t act like an infant. You know why.
FREDRICK
I’m more than just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-Germanspeaking
members of the movie’s audience can understand.
He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they
go on their way.
Shosanna’s eyes narrow.
SHOSANNA
Who are you?
FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
You’re not just a German soldier. Are you
somebody’s son?
FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebody’s son.
SHOSANNA
Yeah, but you’re not just somebody. What are
you, Hitler’s nephew?
He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:
FREDRICK
Yes.
SHOSANNA
Really?
FREDRICK
No, not really. I’m just teasing you.
She leans back, annoyed.
SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German movie
star?
FREDRICK
Not exactly.
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) What does that mean, “not exactly”? I
asked if you were a movie star. The answer to
that question is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.
FREDRICK
When you said that just now, you reminded me of
my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.
FREDRICK
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family-operated cinema in Munich.
Seeing you run around your cinema
reminds me of them. Especially my sister
Helga. She raised me, when our father
wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very
much. You’d like her. She doesn’t wear a
German uniform.
SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?
FREDRICK
All my sisters. I’m the baby, but Helga was the
bossiest.
SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?
FREDRICK
My mother died. And my father was a
loser. My father’s motto: “If at first
you don’t succeed, quit.” The day he
left, good riddance. My sisters are
all I need. It’s why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them
and a little homesick at the same time.
SHOSANNA
Is your cinema still operating?
FREDRICK
Oui.
SHOSANNA
What’s it called?
FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.
SHOSANNA
How has it done during the war?
FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.
SHOSANNA
No doubt. You don’t have to operate under a
curfew.
FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) Not since before the war.
FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that would
help you out?
SHOSANNA
Of course, but that’s not likely to happen.
TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table. They ask for Fredrick’s autograph, and he signs it for
them. One of the French girls says, in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that’s it, she thinks.
SHOSANNA
So you’re a war hero? Why didn’t you tell me?
FREDRICK
Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn’t.
SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.
FREDRICK
I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers
in World War Two . . . so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.
SHOSANNA
Wow.
FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled-off city in Russia. It was
myself and a thousand rounds of ammo
in a bird’s nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.
SHOSANNA
What’s a bird’s nest?
FREDRICK
A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call a
bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a
three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very
advantageous for marksmen.
SHOSANNA
How many Russians did you kill?
FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.
(beat)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the second
day. Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received a lot of
attention in Germany. That’s why they all
recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant
York.
SHOSANNA
Maybe they’ll make a film about
your exploits.
FREDRICK
Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride,” and
guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I
did. They have posters for it in kiosks all
over Paris. That’s another reason for all the
attention.
SHOSANNA
“Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s Pride”
is starring you?
FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?
SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?
FREDRICK
Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having my
pictures taken with different German
luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to
premiere in Paris, so I’ve been helping them in
the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He’s telling anybody who will listen that
when “Nation’s Pride” is released
I’ll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna isn’t falling for the young German by any stretch.
However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can’t
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as “Joseph,”
like they’re friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of
things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises and says:
SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I
hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.
EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY
It’s the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
ladder.
WHEN . . .
. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of
the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema.
In French the driver asks Shosanna:
DRIVER
Is this your cinema?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.
DRIVER
Come down, please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to
get in.
SHOSANNA
I don’t understand. What have I done?
DRIVER
(to major)
She wants to know what she’s done?
GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she’s done anything?
DRIVER
Who says you’ve done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux’s arrogant
manner.
SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about, and
where do you propose to take me?
The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.
INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris
streets.
WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.
EXT/INT—MAXIM’S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFÉ)—DAY
She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris café by the
Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she’s not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxim’s. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it:
Germany’s minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler’s
Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and
mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.
TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit
together in another chair at the table.
We join the in mid-conversation:
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
GOEBBELS
—it’s only the offspring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured
in Negro sweat.
Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major.
Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn’t sure whether or not
you’d accept my invitation.
SHOSANNA
Invitation?
THEN . . .
. . . Goebbels’s voice says OFFSCREEN:
GOEBBELS (OS)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.
FREDRICK
Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is
somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons crème brûlée into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister
formally.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce you
to the minister of propaganda, the leader of
the entire German film industry, and now I’m an
actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to
shake. She does.
GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big bite
of tiramisu.
They all laugh.
Frederick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels’s French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.
NARRATOR’S VOICE comes on soundtrack:
NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels’s
French interpreter.
She’s also Goebbels’s favorite French
actress to appear in his films . . . . .
FLASH ON
FRENCH CLIP
from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG
GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can’t help it. My country or my
heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film’s title:
“SENTIMENTAL COMBAT” (1943)
FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet
bed.
NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels’s favorite French mistress, to act
in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGYSTYLE.
FRANCESCA
(animal-like)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!
BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.
FRANCESCA
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
FREDRICK
And you’ve met the major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn’t introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your
service, Mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me. Have a seat.
The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit
down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered
poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small carafe on the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It’s quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.
GOEBBELS
Well, I must say, you’ve made quite an
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels’s German for Shosanna.
GOEBBELS
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch
with my star . . .
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Little do I know he’s become
the toast of Paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, days,
to see me. For the Führer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So finally, I’m granted an audience
with the young private, and he spends the
entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So Fräulein Mimieux, let’s get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts—
FREDRICK
Herr Goebbels, I haven’t informed
her yet.
GOEBBELS
Unless the girl’s a simpleton, I’m
sure she’s figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French:
FRANCESCA
What they’re trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is
Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller’s
film premiere and change the venue to your
cinema.
Zoller reacts.
FRANCESCA
(FRENCH to Zoller)
What?
FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.
FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.
GOEBBELS
(GERMAN to Francesca)
What’s the issue?
FRANCESCA
The young soldier wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:
GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GOEBBELS
How many?
SHOSANNA
Three.
GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?
SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.
GOEBBELS
That’s almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
But Herr Goebbels, that’s not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn’t want to indulge every
two-faced French bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seats it makes the event more
exclusive. You’re not trying to fill
the house, they’re fighting for seats.
FREDRICK
(CON’T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German military, the
High Command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved by
the exploits onscreen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:
GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I’ve created
a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When
the war’s over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.
GOEBBELS
Well, Private, though it is true
I’m inclined to indulge you anything,
I must watch a film in this young
lady’s cinema before I can say
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So, young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight and have
a private screening for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks . . .
SHOSANNA
My cinema, on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks . . . ?
SHOSANNA
I draw an older German audience in
my cinema that appreciates the
nostalgia of an earlier time.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
That’s nonsense, Fräulein. We Germans
are looking forward, not backward.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create will not
only be the cinema of Europe, but
the world’s only alternative to the degenerate
Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is
quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.
GOEBBELS
So it would appear. Unfortunately
for the Fräulein, I’ve outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says:
FREDRICK
Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”?
I’m sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen it.
And it’s so funny. I’ve been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That’s a great idea.
Let’s watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.
GOEBBELS
Ahhh, “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids,”
“Lucky Kids.” When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not
only that, I
wouldn’t be surprised if sixty
years from now, it’s “Lucky Kids”
that I’m the most remembered for.
I know it doesn’t seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I’ll have a print sent
over to the Fräulein’s cinema.
We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.
As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .
the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.
GOEBBELS
Ah, Landa, you’re here. This is the young lady
in question.
The S.S. officer sits down, and it’s our old friend from the
first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of
the S.S. He’ll be running security
for the premiere.
CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it,
saying in perfect French:
COL. LANDA
Charmed, Mademoiselle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as “the Jew Hunter.”
The table laughs.
GOEBBELS
Oh, Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Führer said about Hans?
FRANCESCA
What thing?
GOEBBELS
You know, you were there. It was a
funny thing the Führer said,
about Hans . . . something about a pig?
Francesca’s memory is jogged.
FRANCESCA
Oh, yes, of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels’s ear.
GOEBBELS
Oh, yes, of course, that’s it. So
the Führer said he wouldn’t be
surprised if Hans weren’t rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the playpen.
FRANCESCA
That’s what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.
COL. LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big, hearty laugh around the table.
GOEBBELS
Do you have an engagement tonight?
COL. LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do—
GOEBBELS
—Break it. We’re all going to the fräulein’s
cinema tonight to view
“Lucky Kids.”
COL. LANDA
Splendid.
Then the Reich minister’s companion, Mademoiselle Mondino,
interrupts:
FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to
his next appointment.
GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .
As Col. Landa stands, he says:
COL. LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion, I’m
afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle
Mimieux.
Mademoiselle Mimieux’s eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.
FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?
COL. LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like
a soldier questioning the order of a colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?
FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth, Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation precedes
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?
GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s
simply smitten. And he’s correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make
their way to front of the café, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.
COL. LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue’s property owner.
FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream
and walk along the Seine another
time. Right now, allow Col. Landa
to do his job.
Everybody says their farewells.
Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxim’s.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter’s
French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at
French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film’s first scene was
simply an interrogation technique.
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?
SHOSANNA
No.
COL. LANDA
It’s not so terrible. So how is it
the young private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She’s about to answer when a WAITER approaches.
COL. LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of
steamed milk on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last
time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her
entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
least . . . disconcerting.
The key to Col. Landa’s power and/or charm, depending on the
side one’s on, lies in his ability to convince you he’s privy to
your secrets.
The waiter exits.
COL. LANDA
So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain . . . ?
SHOSANNA
(anxiously)
Up until a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller
or his exploits. To me, the private
was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke
a few times, but—
COL. LANDA
—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a
simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The strudel arrives.
The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:
COL. LANDA
I apologize. I forgot to order the
crème fraîche.
WAITER
One moment.
He exits.
COL. LANDA
(referring to
the crème.)
Wait for the crème
(back to
business)
So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
COL. LANDA
So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen that a young lady
such as yourself comes to own a
cinema?
The waiter returns, applying crème fraîche to the two strudels.
The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking
up his fork, he says:
COL. LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her
lead.
COL. LANDA
(mouthful
of strudel)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.
COL. LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(back to
business)
So you were explaining the origin of your
cinema ownership?
SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle—
Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.
COL. LANDA
—What are their names?
SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.
COL. LANDA
Where are they now?
SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.
COL. LANDA
Pity . . . Continue.
SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.
COL. LANDA
Regrettable.
(respectful
pause)
It’s come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ. Is that true?
SHOSANNA
Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He
worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He’s the only other one who works
with me.
COL. LANDA
Doing what?
SHOSANNA
Projectionist.
COL. LANDA
Is he any good?
SHOSANNA
The best.
COL. LANDA
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
SHOSANNA
Of course I can.
COL. LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I’m quite positive he wouldn’t want
the success or failure of his illustrious
evening dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass that we hold this event
at your venue—talented, no doubt,
as your negro may be—you will
operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?
As if she has any say.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows
suit.
COL. LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is quite
smitten with you?
SHOSANNA
Private Zoller’s feelings for me
aren’t of a romantic nature.
COL. LANDA
Mademoiselle . . . ?
SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.
COL. LANDA
That doesn’t mean his feelings
aren’t romantic.
SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.
COL. LANDA
It’s sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S.
LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy
S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Cigarette?
SHOSANNA
No, thank you.
COL. LANDA
Do you smoke?
SHOSANNA
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one. They’re not
French, they’re German.
I hope you’re not nationalist about
your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a
sin against nicotine.
She takes one but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deeply and says:
COL. LANDA
I did have something else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can’t remember what it is. Oh,
well, must not have been important.
Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts
on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting
Shosanna, and says:
COL. LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he’s gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and
ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
During her conversation and strudel with the man who
exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her
feet.
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
Onscreen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS.”
We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.
CU GOEBBELS
watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.
CU FRANCESCA
laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.
CU TWO BLACK POODLES
pantingly watching the screen.
CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
smiling, smoking a German cigarette.
CU COL LANDA
smoking a German cigarette, amused.
CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
truly enjoying himself.
CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.
NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel’s
Frank Capra copy “Lucky
Kids,” a thought suddenly comes to her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.
NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose
its minister of
propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew
hunter, all in one fell swoop.
She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she’s
chuckling at the German comedy.
NARRATOR (VO)
But then that thought . . .
. . . led Shosanna
To a crazy idea.
The idea flashes on her face.
Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.
Zoller looks over at her. Happy.
She’s enjoying the movie.
SILVER SCREEN
“The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is projected.
The Nazi rouges’ gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.
The lights go up.
Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
file out into the lobby.
NARRATOR (VO)
The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a complete
success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the
venue changed
to Shosanna’s cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had
an idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:
GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your cinema
has real respect, almost churchlike.
Not to say we couldn’t spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there’s a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. We’re going to get it
and hang it from the very middle of
the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the
Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.
MONTAGE
We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous
crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
into place.
We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge,
heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna’s auditorium,
which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s Italian
B-movie ripoffs of Visconti’s “The Damned.”
SHOSANNA
watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in
disbelief.
BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS
in the lobby, post screening of “Lucky Kids.” She’s soundlessly
escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.
NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy . . .
We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.
NARRATOR (VO)
None more so than Fredrick Zoller.
She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into
Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look
like grotesque Nazi caricatures.
The Nazis are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down
at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
What the fuck are we supposed to do?
SHOSANNA
It looks like we’re supposed to have
a Nazi premiere.
MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to
do?
SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.
MARCEL
About what?
SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.
MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna
has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.
SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching that Boche
(said in
English)
Capra-corn abomination,
(back to
French)
I got an idea.
MARCEL
I’m confused. What are we talking
about?
SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazis and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.
MARCEL
I’m not talking about that. You’re talking
about that.
SHOSANNA
No, we’re talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.
MARCEL
Shosanna—
SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we
wanted to burn down the cinema
for any number of reasons, you and I could
physically accomplish that, no?
MARCEL
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux’s three hundred and fifty
nitrate film print collection,
we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?
MARCEL
You mean we wouldn’t need any more explosives?
SHOSANNA
Oui, that’s exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which
I am, we both know
you’re not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both
caresses and grips her lovely neck.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And you’re the only person on this earth I can
trust.
She then TWISTS around so she’s straddling him. They are now
face to face.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the
filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I
know the film
camera does. How about the sound recorder?
MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a café last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?
SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazis.
She gives him a deep French kiss.
FADE TO BLACK
BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FOUR
“OPERATION KINO”
FADE OFF
INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHÉ opens the sliding double doors
that serve as an entrance to the room.
MILITARY ATTACHÉ
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside
the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,
a young George Sanders type (“The Saint” and “Private Affairs of
Bel Ami” years).
Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind
GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type (“Village of the
Damned”).
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable
bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.
The lieutenant was not expecting him.
Hicox salutes the general.
LT. HICOX
Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.
GEN. FENECH
(salutes back)
General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?
Hicox’s eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
who’s scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind
the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment
of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox
knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn’t introduced, he ain’t
there.
LT. HICOX
If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I
could drink a scotch and
plain water.
GEN. FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like
a good chap,
will you? Bar’s in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.
LT. HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?
GEN. FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and
busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant’s file.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you’ve run three
undercover commando operations in Germany and
German-occupied
territories? Frankfurt, Holland,
and Norway, to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:
LT. HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?
LT. HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
GEN. FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends . . .
LT. HICOX
I’m a film critic.
GEN. FENECH
List your accomplishments?
LT. HICOX
Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews
and articles for a publication called “Films
and Filmmakers.”
As well as our sister publication.
GEN. FENECH
What’s that called?
LT. HICOX
“Flickers Bi-Monthly,” and I’ve had
two books published.
GEN. FENECH
Impressive. Don’t be modest, Lieutenant. What
are their titles?
LT. HICOX
The first book was called “Art of the Eyes, the
Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema
in the Twenties.”
And the second one was called . . .
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general’s
whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.
LT. HICOX
“Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.”
It’s a subtextual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G. W. Pabst.
He hands the general his whiskey.
LT. HICOX
What should we drink to, sir?
GEN. FENECH
(thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.
LT. HICOX
All the way down, sir.
CLINK.
GEN. FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema under the
Third Reich?
LT. HICOX
Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.
GEN. FENECH
Explain it to me.
LT. HICOX
Pardon, sir?
GEN. FENECH
This little escapade of ours
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to
me UFA, under Goebbels?
LT. HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he’s
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema—an alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the twenties and
the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:
CHURCHILL
How’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?
CHURCHILL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to, say,
. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn’t
be Goebbels’ proper opposite number. I believe
Goebbels sees himself closer to David O.
Selznick.
Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:
CHURCHILL
Brief him.
GEN. FENECH
Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I’d like to
brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from
now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—
LT. HICOX
—What film, sir?
The general has to resort to peeking at his file.
GEN. FENECH
The motion pictures called “Nation’s Pride.”
LT. HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?
GEN. FENECH
We don’t have any intelligence on exactly what
the film that night
will be about.
LT. HICOX
But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?
GEN. FENECH
Yes.
LT. HICOX
I can tell you what it’s about.
It’s about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He’s the German Sargeant York.
Fenech can’t help suppress a smile. They have the right man.
GEN. FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion
will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most
of the German High Command, including all the
high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the
Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi
propaganda-film industry.
LT. HICOX
The master race at play, aye?
GEN. FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation
Kino . . . Blow up the basket.
LT. HICOX
(reciting a
poem)
. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone
from this earth. Jolly good, sir.
GEN. FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist. The Germans call them “the
Basterds.”
LT. HICOX
“The Basterds.” Never heard of them.
GEN. FENECH
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them
the devil. Their leader is a chap
named Lieutenant Aldo Raine. The
Germans call him “Aldo the Apache.”
LT. HICOX
Why do they call him that?
GEN. FENECH
Best guess is because he removes the scalps of
the Nazi dead.
LT. HICOX
Scalps, sir?
GEN. FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.
GEN. FENECH
Like a red Injun.
LT. HICOX
Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird,
isn’t he?
GEN. FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But
you’ve heard the
expression “It takes a thief.”
LT. HICOX
Indeed.
Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
to a military map.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four
kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will
be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a
little village called Nadine.
(He points it out
on the map.)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there’s a tavern called
La Louisiane. You’ll rendezvous
with our double agent, and she’ll take it from
there. She’s the one who’s
going to get you into the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two Germanborn
members of the Basterds. She’s
also made all the other arrangements you’re
going to need.
LT. HICOX
How will I know her?
GEN. FENECH
I suspect that won’t be too much
trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von
Hammersmark.
LT. HICOX
Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star
is working for England?
GEN. FENECH
For the last two years now. One could even say
Operation Kino was her brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks:
CHURCHILL
Extraordinary woman.
LT. HICOX
Quite.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She’ll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?
LT. HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.
EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema
literally making a movie.
Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
positioned low, looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
into it.
A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what.
MARCEL
We need a sync mark.
SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?
MARCEL
An action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.
SHOSANNA
How do we do that?
MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.
MARCEL
In frame, imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.
MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:
SHOSANNA
Ready.
MARCEL
Action.
WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .
THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE
LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big difference. This time, it’s in COLOR.
MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop
that footage. How do we get
a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?
MARCEL
Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,
took care of all the experimental filmmakers.
But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what you’re talking about. If the
Nazis found out, their life wouldn’t
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.
SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you either eat the
wolf or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to
obliterate the Nazis,
we have to use their tactics.
MARCEL
What does that mean?
SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print. And we
make them do it or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway or they’ll turn us in.
MARCEL
Would you do that?
SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.
INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT
A old mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties.
Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING
at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.
SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel holds Gaspar’s arm behind him as he forces his head flat
against the tabletop.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
his face.
SHOSANNA
You either do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I’ll bury this ax in your
collaborating skull.
GASPAR
I’m not a collaborator!
SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do
his wife and children
know you?
MARCEL
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we’ll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .
SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!
CUT TO
GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside
the shop window, it’s morning.
INT—PROJECTION ROOM
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller’s
life story, “Nation’s Pride” (clearly marked), on the floor of
the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.
Shosanna’s at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the
rewinds . . .
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel’s footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick’s
film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.
BLACK FRAME
FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out
front that reads “La Louisiane.”
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“The village of
Nadine, France”
TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
German gray S.S. captain’s uniform. They look out of a window, in
an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.
LT. ALDO
You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a
fuckin’ basement.
LT. HICOX
I didn’t know.
LT. ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?
LT. HICOX
It is a tavern.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin’ in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being
you’re fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant’s
uniform.
WICKI
What if we go in there and she’s
not even there?
LT. HICOX
We wait. Don’t worry. She’s a British spy.
She’ll make the rendezvous.
WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray
uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his
boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd’s opening
chapter is dead.
Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the
room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.
Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .
Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz, right?
STIGLITZ
That’s right, sir.
He continues bringing the blade’s edge up, then down on the leather
strap.
LT. HICOX
I hear you’re pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade.
Stiglitz doesn’t answer.
LT. HICOX
You know, we’re not looking for
trouble right now. We’re simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I’m wrong and things prove
eventful, I need to know we can all remain
calm.
The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade’s progress and
looks up at the limey lieutenant.
STIGLITZ
I don’t look calm to you?
LT. HICOX
Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:
LT. HICOX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.
LT. ALDO
Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious
type?
LT. HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.
LT. ALDO
So y’all git in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
LT. HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans or French, for that matter—
escape from that basement.
If Fräulein von Hammersmark’s cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.
Donny chimes in:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Speaking of Fräulein von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?
LT. HICOX
She chose the spot.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Well, isn’t that just dandy?
LT. HICOX
Look, she’s not a military strategist. She’s
just an actress.
LT. ALDO
Ya don’t got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don’t want to
fight in a basement.
LT. HICOX
She wasn’t picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin’ on
Louisiana two o’clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.
LT. HICOX
Shit.
Sgt. Donowitz chides him:
SGT. DONOWITZ
So what do you think your Fräulein
von Hammer—
LT. HICOX
—Obviously, I don’t know, Sergeant.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who’s not
supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
in hand.
STIGLITZ
If we’re going, let’s go.
He sheaths the dagger.
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task.
Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .
INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging
basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the
only other space in the little tavern is taken
up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both
halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the
two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
five.
FIVE NAZIS
ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a
powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.
The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and
playing a very fun game with none other than the Fräulein of
the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the
nines in a chic, forties-style woman’s suit, complete with fedora.
The game they’re playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
stuck to their forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is
on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
out who they are.
The five Germans’ five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);
FEMALE SGT #2: (BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);
GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5:
(WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It’s German #5’s (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
WINNETOU
. . . okay, I’m not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN
Yes, you are!
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, if he’s so American, how come
he’s never been translated into
English. He’s not American. He’s supposed to be
American, but he’s not
an American creation. In fact, he’s something
very different.
WINNETOU
Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character, from
the past. I’m American, and that’s
controversial.
BRIDGET/GENGUS
No, it’s not controversial. The nationality of
the author has nothing to do with
the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet’s not British, he’s Danish.
So, yes, this character was born in
America.
WINNETOU
Well, I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a wife,
would she be called a squaw?
He’s got it.
The table laughs.
THE TABLE
YES!
WINNETOU
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
THE TABLE
Yes!
WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?
THE TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German
officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement
tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they’re
too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No
doubt they’re less than happy. Fräuhlein von Hammersmark
sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.
BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies. I will join you
in moments. I’m finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.
LT. HICOX
No hurry, Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Take your time. Enjoy yourself.
BRIDGET
(to Winnetou)
So who are you?
WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card
off his forehead.
The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of
the game).
Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.
MATA HARI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, when your friends
came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the movies?
BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that
at all.
MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now. Did they
teach you how to do a double take in the
movies?
BRIDGET
Well, yes, they did, but it’s not really that
difficult.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The table heartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, double take.
The table loves it.
MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double
take.
EDGAR WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.
HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don’t
understand.
THEN . . .
Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the
table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.
BRIDGET
Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.
She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans’ table. The
gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek
kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey.
The tavern’s PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more
champagne into Bridget’s champagne glass. He leaves, returning back
behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
LT. HICOX
I thought this place was supposed to have more
French than Germans?
BRIDGET
Normally that’s true. The sergeant over there’s
wife just had a baby. His commanding officer
gave him and his
mates the night off to celebrate.
WICKI
We should leave.
BRIDGET
No, we should stay. For one drink at least.
I’ve been waiting for you in a bar. It would
look strange if we left before we had a drink.
LT. HICOX
She’s right. Just be calm, and enjoy your
booze.
BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French barmaid has taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy
game. She tells them her person must be French or she
won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:
NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS’ TABLE
BRIDGET
There’s been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.
LT. HICOX
Why?
BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t be a
problem. The cinema
it’s been changed to is considerably smaller
than The Ritz. So whatever materials you
brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective
here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to overreact.
The Führer will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.
Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing.
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they
did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
get wet.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
BRIDGET
(to Hicox)
You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll say
you’re an associate producer on Riefenstahl’s
“Tiefland.” It’s the
one German production not under Goebbels’
control, and Leni wouldn’t be caught dead at a
Goebbels film affair.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily,
at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in
the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and
head toward Fräulein von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
. . . the film’s gone through many delays, and
Leni’s health is deteriorating, so if you have
to speak . . .
Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her
to cool it.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking,
could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?
BRIDGET
I’d love to, Wilhelm.
(to the table)
This handsome happy sergeant just became a
father today.
The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.
The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his
superior officers.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you. Heil Hitler.
He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: “Heil
Hitler.”
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .
BRIDGET
So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this
progeny yet?
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, Fräulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.
STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sergeant.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old enough to
ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side “The Blue Max.”
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.
BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I’m not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick,
applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the
napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured
item to the young officer.
BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Fräulein, thank you. Max may not
know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in
Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no
Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his
table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is
drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
So, Fräulein von Hammersmark, what brings you
to France?
Feeling any good Nazi officer’s patience would have been
exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.
LT. HICOX
None of your business, Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with
the fräulein with your drunken, boorish
behavior, but you have worn out your welcome
with me.
The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.
LT. HICOX
Might I remind you Sergeant, you’re an enlisted man.
This is an officers’ table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fräulein and
rejoin your table.
The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very
unusual.
The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two Germanborn
imposters spring into action.
WICKI
Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to
speak to a superior officer with
such impertinence!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:
STIGLITZ
I’m making YOU . . .
(pointing at
Winnetou)
. . . and YOU . . .
(pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
. . . responsible for him.
(pointing at
Sgt. Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or
he’ll spend Max’s first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!
The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .
WHEN . . .
A GERMAN VOICE rings out:
GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German
in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:
MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from
the little table he was sitting at.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young, newly christened father, I to
have an acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Wicki jumps in:
WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—I wasn’t speaking to you,
Lieutenant Saltzberg,
(turning to
Stiglitz)
or you either, Lieutenant Berlin.
(looking at
Hicox)
I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.
The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the
imposter’s table.
Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.
LT. HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Pitz Palu.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?
LT. HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.
LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch
scene?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes, I do.
LT. HICOX
In that scene were myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is
so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a
closeup.
As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette
holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her
she says:
BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch
for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he
was in the film, and his brother is far more
handsome than he.
The imposters laugh.
Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table
begins playing their game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows
graciously to the female German celebrity.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?
BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki.
The French barmaid brings over the Major’s beer stein.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that’s the source of your bizarre accent?
Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here, Captain?
LT. HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fräulein?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle . . . chuckle
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. You’re obviously not
stationed in France, or I’d know who
you are.
LT. HICOX
You know every German in France?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Worth knowing.
LT. HICOX
Well, therein lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?
LT. HICOX
Attending Goebbels’s film premiere as
the fräulein’s escort.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You’re the fräulein’s escort?
LT. HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
BRIDGET
The captain is my date, but all three are my
guests. We’re old friends, Major, who go back a
long time. Longer than
an actress would care to admit.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.
BRIDGET
I’ll drink to that.
They cheers.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS’ TABLE
They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.
BACK TO THE OFFICERS’ TABLE
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game they’re playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t
join them, because you’re quite right, Captain,
officers and enlisted men shouldn’t
fraternize. But seeing as we’re all
officers here,
(bowing to
Bridget)
. . . and sophisticated lady friends of
officers, what say we play the game?
Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better)
interrupts him:
BRIDGET
Okay, one game.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Wunderbar.
The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game is to write
the name of a famous person on your card. Real
or fictitious, doesn’t matter. For instance,
you could write Confucius or
Fu Manchu.
(He SNAPS his fingers.)
Eric! More pens.
(back to the players)
And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When
you finish writing, put the card face down on
the table and move it to the person to your
left. The person to your right will move their
card in
front of you. You pick up the card without
looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on
your forehead, like so.
He demonstrates.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(con’t)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess
who you are . . .
As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
STIGLITZ. The major’s dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Until we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED
FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a
GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.
The flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being
this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into
it.
The major’s voice comes back on the soundtrack.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
. . . So let’s give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The five players write their names . . .
Then move their cards to the left . . .
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .
MAJOR BRIDGET WILHELM ARCHIE HUGO
HELLSTROM VON HAMMERSMARK WICKI HICOX STIGLITZ
is is is is is
KING G.W. BULLDOG BRIGITTE MARCO
KONG PABST DRUMMOND HELM POLO
MAJ. KING KONG
I’ll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
They laugh.
BRIDGET
No.
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I an American?
They laugh—but then Wicki says:
WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to—
BRIDGET
Don’t be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn’t born
in America.
MAJ. KING KONG
So . . . I visited America, aye?
The table says, “Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Was this visit . . . fortuitous?
WICKI
Not for you.
MAJ. KING KONG
. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one
would call exotic?
The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.
MAJ. KING KONG
Hummm. That could be either a reference to the
jungle or the Orient. I’m going to let my first
instinct take over and ask, am I from the
jungle?
The table says, “Yes, you are.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask
whether you’re real or fictitious.
I, however, think that’s too easy, so I won’t
ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the
jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not
fortuitous to me, but the implication is that
it was to somebody else. When I went from the
jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed
in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The table says, “No.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Well, then, I must be King Kong.
He throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to
finish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who’s next?
LT. HICOX
Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the four of
us are very good friends. And the four of us
haven’t seen each other in quite a while. So .
. .
Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ, Captain. It’s only if the
fräulein considers my presence an
intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein? Am I intruding?
BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn’t think so. It’s simply the young
captain is immune to my charms.
The table’s not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation?
Then the major laughs.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I’m just joking. Of course, I’m intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and
I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
(leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old
single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish
highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?
LT. HICOX
You’re most gracious, sir.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You
don’t want to contaminate the thirty-three with
the swill you were drinking.
ERIC
How many glasses?
LT. HICOX
Five glasses.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn’t like me.
BRIDGET
Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly.
Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric,
the owner.
LT. HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for
the three soldiers.
Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:
MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand-year Reich!
They all mutter, “a thousand-year reich” and clink glasses.
The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
CLICK under the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That’s the sound of
my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.
LT. HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you’ve just given yourself
away, captain. You’re no more German than
scotch.
LT. HICOX
Well, Major—
BRIDGET
—Major—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—Shut up, slut.
(to Hicox)
You were saying?
LT. HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve had a
gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
SGT. STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.
UNDER THE TABLE
We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well
as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi major’s. Her pretty
gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.
SGT. STIGLITZ
And at this range, I’m a real
Fredrick Zoller.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.
LT. HICOX
What’s going to happen, Major, is you’re going
to stand up and walk out that
door with us.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don’t think so. I’m
afraid you and I both know, no matter what
happens to anybody else in this room, the two of
us aren’t going anywhere.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing at the table
behind him)
Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.
If any of you expect to live, you’ll have to shoot
them too.
(pause)
Looks like little Max is going to grow up an
orphan. How sad.
BRIDGET
Then, Major, I implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops
gets me . . .
(pointing at
his heart)
. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your
whore legs, don’t you? You can’t afford to get
any bullet holes in them. You’re not finished
spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt
scotch and says:
LT. HICOX
(ENGLISH)
Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope
you don’t mind if I go out speaking
the king’s?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
By all means, Captain.
The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three
the Nazi major bought him and says:
LT. HICOX
There’s a special rung in hell reserved for
people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily . . .
He downs the stuff.
LT. HICOX
(to the Nazi
major)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
He puts the glass down.
LT. HICOX
Now about this pickle we find
ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one
thing left for you to do.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz.
STIGLITZ
Say, “auf Widersehen” to your balls!
STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS . . .
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
well.
HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX’s BALLS and KNEECAPS.
STIGLITZ
then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the
DAGGER.
HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.
WICKI
brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS
FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still
PLAYING THE GAME.
WINNETOU
is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.
EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each
other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS
it’s almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the
floor.
WICKI and MATA HARI
both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is
HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the
whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI,
and THE BARMAID.
The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . .
starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is
the
young German sergeant with the machine gun.
WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement
entrance.
The door opens . . .
The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door’s
direction . . .
No one goes through it.
What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one
inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.
The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:
GERMAN SERGEANT
You outside! Who are you? British, American,
what?
Aldo’s voice YELLS down the hole:
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
We’re Americans! What are you?
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a German, you idiot!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
You speak English pretty good for a German!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I agree! So let’s talk!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, talk!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max!
We were in here drinking and celebrating!
They’re the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It’s not my fault!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!
What’s your name, soldier?
GERMAN SERGEANT
Wilhelm!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
That’s the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!
WILHELM
They attacked us!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive
on our side?
WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:
BRIDGET’S VOICE (OS)
I’m alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.
On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive
Bridget von Hammersmark.
The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at
the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Who’s that?
WILHELM
(to BRIDGET,
low)
Make a sound, whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?
WILHELM
Is the girl on your side?
Pause.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Which girl?
WILHELM
Who do you think—von Hammersmark!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Yeah, she’s ours!
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the Americans
now, huh? Now times are
bad?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Is she okay?
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(to Aldo)
She’s been shot, but she’s alive.
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm, what’d ya say we
make a deal?
WILHELM
What’s your name?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?
WILHELM
Yes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four
or five or six grenades down there and your
little war story ends here. But good fer you,
bad fer her.
You die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?
WILLI
Keep talking!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Willi, here’s my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little Max
gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy!
So what ‘ya say, Willi, we got a deal?
Willi thinks . . .
Bridget watches Willi think . . .
WILLI
Aldo?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
I’m here, Willi!
WILLI
I want to trust you . . . But how can I?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
What choice ya got?
WILLI
I could kill the girl!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Well, now, Willi, that’s true enough. But
something you need to know, so
you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t
none of us give a fuck ‘bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be
dead by then anyway, so
what’d you care? And let’s not
forget that little Katzenjammer
Max, growin’ up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin’ you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?
WILLI
Okay, Aldo. I’m going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.
Aldo, with his hands up, says:
ALDO
Hey, Willi, what’s with the machine
gun? I thought we had a deal.
WILLI
We do have a deal. Now get the girl
and go.
ALDO
Not so fast, Willi. We only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff
ain’t trust.
WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican standoff.
ALDO
You got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we’re dead. Up top, they got grenades,
they drop ’em down here, you’re dead. That’s a
Mexican
standoff, and that wasn’t the deal.
WILLI
Just take that fuckin’ traitor and
go! See? Now you’re down here—
Now you get tricky—!
ALDO
—No tricks!—Ain’t nobody gittin’
tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I’m
too damn dumb to get tricky. But
(meaning
Hirschberg)
him and I lived up to the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it’s
your turn. No trust, no deal.
Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .
ALDO
I know you’re scared. I’m scared,
he’s scared, we’re all scared.
So what’s it gonna be, Willi?
Either we got a deal or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides . . .
He puts the machine gun down on the bar.
WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.
ALDO
Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab
her shoulder—
WHEN . . .
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom’s
WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain
(she’ll probably lose that leg} German movie star says to the
two American soldiers she’s just meeting for the first time:
BRIDGET
He was an enemy soldier who knew who
I was. He couldn’t live.
INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT
An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
bed, in his bedroom . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . . OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .
. . . . . The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING . . .
and the sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .
his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES
IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a
.45 automatic to his head.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Doctor?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
What? What’s happening?
Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man’s head, shocking,
scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Andiamo . . .
Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost
comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
against him hurts more) toward the door . . .
INT—DOCTOR’S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
. . . Into a doctor’s examining room built into a French country
house, with an examining table and medical instruments.
However, it’s obviously the medical examining room
of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING
dogs in them.
The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in
excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl’s
direction . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
She’s been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .
(pointing at
his leg)
. . . in leg . . . understand?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
No, no, no, I don’t speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!
The old man nods his head, yes.
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
But I’m a veterinarian . . . animals . . .
I take care of animals . . .
Bridget screams from the table . . .
BRIDGET
(ENGLISH)
He’s a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!
SGT. DONOWITZ
He’s still a doctor. If he can get
a bullet out of a cow, he can get
a bullet outta you.
LT. ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The old man tries to explain in French that he’s not a human doctor
. . .
Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
BANG
He SHOOTS another dog . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.
CUT TO
The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.
INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT
We’re back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands
over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile
breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Ahhh, Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world, I
see. Lieutenant. And with
your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.
COL. LANDA
And that one’s . . .
(pointing at
Wicki)
. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He’s an Austrianborn
Jew who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites. They are
the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They’ve been known
to don German uniforms to ambush squads.
FLASH ON
three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German
soldiers. The three soldiers’ back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet
holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:
SGT. GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
But that doesn’t look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he sees something . . .
Bending down, he examines Fräulein von Hammersmark’s two
pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.
COL. LANDA
It would appear somebody’s missing. Somebody
fashionable.
AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out:
SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)
Colonel, this one’s still alive!
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He’s
shot in the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.
INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
German lady.
LT. ALDO
Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need
to answer a few questions.
BRIDGET
Few questions about what?
LT. ALDO
About I got three men dead back there, and why
don’t you try tellin’ us what the fuck
happened?
BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo major saw it.
LT. ALDO
’Fore we get into who shot John,
Why did you invite my men to a
rendezvous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?
BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn’t see
what happened inside, the Nazis
being there must look odd.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English. It’s called
suspicious.
BRIDGET
Don’t let your imagination get the better of
you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His
commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
Aldo thinks for a moment . . .
LT. ALDO
Okay, I’ll buy that. He was either
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
son’s birthday. He wasn’t doin’ both.
LT. ALDO
How did the shootin’ start?
BRIDGET
The English man gave himself away.
LT. ALDO
How did he do that?
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.
BRIDGET
This is the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would and did notice it.
LT. ALDO
Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans, and
everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to. What would of been
the next step?
BRIDGET
Tuxedoes. To get them into the
premiere wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
have been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody
else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedoes tonight.
LT. ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?
BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the
film premiere.
BRIDGET
Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman
and his assistant.
LT. ALDO
Can you still get us into that
premiere?
BRIDGET
Can you speak German better than your friends?
No. Have I been shot? Yes.
I don’t see me tripping the light fantastic up
the red carpet anytime
soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.
(pause)
However, there’s something you don’t know.
There’s been two recent developments regarding
Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz to a much
smaller venue.
LT. ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s not
very Germanic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin’ stuff so damn peculiar?
BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.
LT. ALDO
Which is?
FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler,
aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner
with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
THE FUHRER
(GERMAN)
I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to
your Paris premiere of “Nation’s Pride.” As the
weeks have
gone on and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous
for us. And I’m beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.
BACK TO BRIDGET
BRIDGET
The Führer’s attending the premiere.
Donny breaks the team’s silence:
SGT. DONOWITZ
What?
LT. ALDO
When the hell did this happen?
BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Führer’s attendance, four days
ago.
LT. ALDO
And how come London don’t know
nothing about that?
BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London knows, it
learned from me. If I
don’t know, London doesn’t know.
So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s
coming to Paris.
SGT. DONOWITZ
FUCK A DUCK!
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
information.
BRIDGET
What are you thinking?
LT. ALDO
I’m thinking getting a wack at
plantin’ ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.
BRIDGET
What’s that supposed to mean?
LT. ALDO
It means you’re gettin’ us into that premiere.
BRIDGET
I’m going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye, acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?
LT. ALDO
The doggie doc’s gonna dig that slug outta your
gam. Then he’s gonna wrap
it up in a cast, and you gotta good
“how I broke my leg mountain climbing” story.
That’s German, ain’t it?
Y’all like climbin’ mountains,
don’t cha?
BRIDGET
I don’t. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.
LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it’s comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.
BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a
wall, it won’t hurt
so much.
(changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
Americans speak any other language
than English?
HIRSCHBERG
Other than Yiddish?
BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:
SGT. DONOWITZ
We both speak a little Italian.
BRIDGET
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn’t exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don’t have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and
brazen through it, is
that the plan?
LT. ALDO
That’s about it.
BRIDGET
That sounds good.
LT. ALDO
It sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?
BRIDGET
No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it
with that, I can get you in the building.
(changes tone)
So, who does what?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak the most Italian, so
I’ll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he’ll be your Italian
cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he’ll be Donny’s assistant.
HIRSCHBERG
I don’t speak Italian.
LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin’ mouth shut. In fact, why don’t you
start practicing right now.
BRIDGET
(meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?
UTIVICH
Do you mean me?
BRIDGET
I didn’t mean any offense.
UTIVICH
None taken, you German cunt.
LT. ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.
UTIVICH
I can’t drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:
BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!
UTIVICH
Gimmie a break. I’m from Manhattan.
LT. ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours
before the movie tomorrow.
More than enough time for you to learn to
drive.
UTIVICH
No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it’s not!
LT. ALDO
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And
yes, yes, yes, you will.
(changes tone)
Look, Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain’t copyin’ off of my test.
Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a
Tennessee mountain road.
And I’m a shit-for-brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?
HIRSCHBERG
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Teach ’im.
BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I’m a movie star. This
is a movie premiere.
I can’t show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But
sometime tomorrow I
have to get my hair done.
All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.
LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who
went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.
BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FIVE
“REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE”
FADE OFF
INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL’S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT
We’re in Shosanna and Marcel’s living quarters above the
cinema. We’ve never been in here before.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:
“NIGHT OF ‘NATION’S PRIDE’ PREMIERE”
Shosanna’s standing before a full-length mirror in a real
attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She’s stunning.
This is the first time in her life she’s had the opportunity
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard
coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the
Germanic miasma below.
SHOSANNA’S POV
WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests
dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up
the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally)
leading into Shosanna’s cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing
away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the
fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS
providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the
lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very
fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the periodstyle
black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it’s
on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.
From this point on, there’s no turning back. It’s all the way baby,
all the fucking way!
INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes
through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She
takes out a key and opens it.
INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT
Marcel’s prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for
reel five (which should never see the light of a projector)
lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection
booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.
SHOSANNA
Shut up, fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips
meet.
SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let’s go over it again?
MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.
SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film comes on
in the fourth reel, so somewhere
toward the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!
INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the
swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi
military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German
celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne
from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with
theater stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all
their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress
uniform.
CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from
a looking-down perspective of the guests entering the building.
THEN . . .
A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa’s
think bubble a little scene plays out.
THINK BUBBLE
A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and
screams at everybody:
COL. LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.
COL. LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It’s none
other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.
COL. LANDA
Can you speak, Sergeant?
SGT. WILLI
(weakly)
Yes, Colonel.
COL. LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in there.
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and
as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed
lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their
tuxedos flank her.
CU COL. LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Fräulein von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?
BRIDGET
Col. Landa, it’s been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
COL. LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere, Fräulein.
They chuckle and air kiss.
COL. LANDA
So what’s happened to your lovely
leg? A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.
BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests to fall into that honeypot.
Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .
COL. LANDA
Seriously, what happened?
BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.
COL. LANDA
Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured your
leg—mountain climbing?
BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes, it is.
A brief moment passes between the two . . .
THEN . . .
The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in
fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .
COL. LANDA
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don’t mean to laugh at
your misfortune. It’s just
. . . mountain climbing? I’m curious, Fräulein,
what could have ever
compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy
endeavor?
The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.
BRIDGET
Well, I shan’t be doing it again, I can tell
you that.
COL. LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this
mountain, last night?
BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday
morning.
COL. LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a second.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.
COL. LANDA
I’m just teasing you, Fräulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?
BRIDGET
I’m afraid neither of the three speak a word of
German. They’re friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(meaning Donny)
And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
The German Fräulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing
Basterds.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel
Hans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
but they can’t show it.
Aldo sticks out his hand . . .
LT. ALDO
Buongiorno.
The German takes his hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Margheriti . . .
(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?
LT. ALDO
(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .
. ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
I’m sorry, again . . . ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Once more . . .?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
Margheriti.
(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
What’s your name again?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Again . . . ?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg . . .
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the
group:
HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Dominick Decocco?
HIRSCHBERG
Dominic Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Bravo . . . Bravo.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find their seats.
Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Not so fast. Let’s enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us. I have some friends I’d
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
Merci.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle
Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she
is our hostess for the evening.
(FRENCH)
And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and
none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is
Bridget von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
BRIDGET
(FRENCH)
I’m afraid my companions don’t speak
any French. They’re Italian. This is Antonio,
Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
Actually, Fräulein von Hammersmark’s Italian
associates need help finding their seats.
Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind
as to escort them?
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black
uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .
Hirschberg . . .
reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .
He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because
if he’s successful tonight he’s going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says:
HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.
The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian
boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of
Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight,
she’s going to burn him alive, and says:
SHOSANNA
Prego.
BACK TO THE LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
YELLS IN GERMAN:
GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seats!
Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
I must call the Führer. He doesn’t
want to make his entrance until everybody is
seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The
Führer has
heard you’re here, and he wishes to commend you
personally.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Me? Why?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with
your resolve. An accident like you’ve just
experienced, and
yet you still show up to an
important party event. The Führer
was quite adamant in his gratitude. We’ll use
Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office.
(to Aldo
in Italian)
I’m afraid I must rob you of your companion,
but only for a moment.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently the Führer wishes to commend
me.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain
her long.
What are either of them supposed to do, argue?
Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers
in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he’s saying, leave the boy
alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?
Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna’s office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
auditorium, till it’s only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers
in the now-vacant lobby.
INT—SHOSANNA’S OFFICE—NIGHT
Shosanna’s cinema manager’s office. It’s small, cluttered, and
dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.
COL. LANDA
Have a seat, Fräulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and
places it in front of the fräulein.
He sits, their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?
Patting his lap.
COL. LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.
BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.
COL. LANDA
I assure you, Fräulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fräulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot
and places it in the colonel’s lap.
The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that
hold the fräulein’s shoe on her foot . . .
. . . . He removes the shoe . . .
. . . . Leaving only the fräulein’s bare foot . . .
THEN . . .
He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe
the fräulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .
He slips it on her foot . . .
. . . . It fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.
Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
What’s that American expression . . .
“If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it.”
He removes her foot from his lap.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
What now, Colonel?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Do you admit your treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
The only think I will admit to is resisting you
. . .
(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches . . .
(GERMAN)
. . . to my last breath.
COL. LANDA
“Resist to your last breath”?
SUDDENLY . . .
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
von Hammersmark’s lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the
violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridget’s face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat.
Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT
OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on
the elegant lady’s neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF
HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
She’s dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are
TREMBLING . . .
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling
that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK
(filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.
Into the phone, in German, he says:
COL. LANDA
Inform the Führer the audience has
taken their seats, and we’re ready
to begin.
Step one in Hans’s master plan, done.
He then dials another number . . .
INT—LOBBY—NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . . He’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .
He’s THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modernday
Secret Service, within seconds his wrists are handcuffed behind
his back and he’s searched. They find the BOMB attached to his
ankle. It’s removed, and a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his head.
Then he’s hoisted up and RUSHED out of the building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the
auditorium is none the wiser . . .
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the
master race, waiting for showtime.
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red
carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.
Aldo’s put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he’s SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany, Germans, German food, German
shepherd . . . anything.
COL. LANDA’S VOICE (OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner,
says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo
Raine, I presume?
LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?
COL. LANDA
You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you’re now in the hands of the S.S. My
hands to be exact. And they’ve been waiting a
long time to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo’s
face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo’s head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.
COL. LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur’s uniform,
bound and bagged like the lieutenant.
The truck drives off.
Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler’s motorcade
pull up to the cinema. Then the Führer, Goebbels, Francesca, and
the rest of the entourage make their way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.
EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.
INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the
truck.
Utivich is crying inside his hood.
LT. ALDO
Utivich?
UTIVICH
Is that you, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yep.
UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
LT. ALDO
No, I do not.
UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.
LT. ALDO
Nothin’ to be sorry about, son.
This bag get to anyone.
UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?
LT. ALDO
John Wayne’s a pampered movie star.
He bursts into tears if his cook
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin’ a bag over his head and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich giggles through the tears.
LT. ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin’
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich’s foot, and places his foot
on top.
The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.
EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La
Louisaiane).
The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.
INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open
for something else rustic tavern.
The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now
see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way
radio set up in the tavern.
Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated
American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.
COL. LANDA
Italian? Really?
(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been thinking?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak a little Italian—
COL. LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn’t begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don’t get me
wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what
with you losing your Germans. And I have
nothing but admiration for improvisation.
Still . . . Chico Marx is more
convincing. If the three of you had
shown up at the premiere dressed
in woman’s attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landa’s eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert outside.
They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the
private, and a German radio man in the corner.
COL. LANDA
So you’re Aldo the Apache?
LT. ALDO
So you’re the Jew Hunter?
COL. LANDA
Jew Hunter (pfuit). I’m a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally
I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.
UTIVICH
Well, you do hafta admit, it is
catchy.
COL. LANDA
Do you control the nicknames your enemies
bestow on you? Aldo the
Apache and the Little Man?
UTIVICH
What do you mean, the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
The German’s nickname for you.
UTIVICH
The German’s nickname for me is the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
Or the “Little One”, either one means you.
And as if to make my point, I’m a
little surprised how tall you
are in real life. I mean, you’re a
little fellow. But not circus-midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.
LT. ALDO
Where are my men? Where is Bridget
von Hammersmark?
COL. LANDA
Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I’m sure she’s in
whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Well, let’s just say she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paisanos
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—
LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?
COL. LANDA
Lt. Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t
interrogate every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors . . . ?
We simply aren’t operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg
and Donowitz should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.
And your mission, some
would call it a terrorist plot, as of
this moment is still a go.
The two basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.
LT. ALDO
That’s a pretty exciting story.
What’s next, Eliza on the ice?
COL. LANDA
However, all I have to do is
pick up that phone right there,
inform the cinema, and your plans
kaput.
LT. ALDO
IF they’re still there, and IF they’re still
alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no
way you gonna take
them boys without settin’ off them bombs.
COL. LANDA
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die, and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you’ve done to his big night. But you
won’t get Hitler, you won’t
get Goebbels, you won’t get Goering,
and you won’t get Boormann. And you
need all four to end the war.
(pause)
But if I don’t pick up that phone
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war . . . tonight.
The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills
three glasses. As he pours, he says:
COL. LANDA
So, gentlemen, let’s discuss the prospect of
ending the war . . . tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.
COL. LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitler’s death, or
possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .
. It’s as if I’m causing his death, even more
than yourselves.
Would you agree?
LT. ALDO
I guess so.
COL. LANDA
How about you, Utivich?
UTIVICH
I guess so too.
COL. LANDA
Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I
have no intention of killing Hitler, and
killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and
killing Boormann, not to mention winning the
war single-handedly for the Allies,
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.
Now they get it.
COL. LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
we have to make a deal.
LT. ALDO
What kinda deal?
COL. LANDA
The kind you wouldn’t have the
authority to make. However, I’m sure this
mission of yours has a
commanding officer? A general, I’m betting. For
. . .
(thinking)
. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.
COL. LANDA
Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, that’s a bingo?
LT. ALDO
You just say, bingo.
COL. LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a
very capable two-way
radio. And sitting behind it is a
more than capable radio operator
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the power of
the pen to authorize my—
let’s call it, the terms of my conditional
surrender, if that tastes better going down.
BACK TO THE PREMIER
Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH. She flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna throws the lever on the first projector.
The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM . . .
FILM REELS rotate . . .
35mm FILM moves through the projector’s film gate . . .
The opening seal of a film by the THIRD REICH flickers on the
SCREEN . . .
Goebbels and Francesca watch . . .
Hitler watches . . .
Fredrick watches . . .
Donowitz and Hirschberg watch . . .
Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window . . .
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna to the clearly marked film
can, REEL 4. The SURPRISE REEL.
BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the
other end.
COL. LANDA
. . . So, when the military history of this
night is written, it will be recorded that I
was part of
Operation Kino from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I’ve done in my guise as an S.S.
colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a
necessary evil to
establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine’s dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels’s opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last
part is actually true.
FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
I want my full military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.
He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided
conversation.
COL. LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of “Operation
Kino” to receive the Congressional Medal of
Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that
goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to purchase
property for me on
Nantucket island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I’ve saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist Party to a
swifter than imagined end. Do you
have all that, sir?
(pause)
I look forward to seeing you face to face as
well, sir.
(pause)
He’s right here.
The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his
orders:
RADIO VOICE (OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck and bring
them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir.
The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.
COL. LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschberg’s success.
You too, Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson
Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.
COL. LANDA
Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.
CHEERS.
BACK TO THE PREMIERE
WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in
a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.
A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers
the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
What’s the death toll?
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.
WE HEAR A SHOT.
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
48. General, I implore you, we must destroy
that tower!
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand
years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.
SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes “REEL 4” (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares
it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing
now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to be
show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much
to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
die wet one on her.
DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM
NAZIS. They’ve developed a dopey way of communicating with each
other in this hostile environment.
Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian
they say English words, only adding an “I” or “A” or “O”
to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian
accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:
They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ITALIAN-ISH)
I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.)
When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb.)
Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can’t set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazis.
Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his
ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of
the auditorium in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn’t get it.
HIRSCHBER
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
patience.
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a.
(They’re looking at the screen, not you.)
HIRSCHBERG
Fantastic-o.
(Fantastic.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o
(pointing to
watch)
You-a, pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and
get out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
What-o?
(What?)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought “What-a” meant “What.”
Does “What-o” mean “What,” as well?)
HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a “What-a.”
(Oh, sorry, I meant what.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a,
five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and
get the fuck out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Good-a, luck-a.
(Good luck.)
Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark
auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the
Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.
DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers’
gossip. They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through
them.
They look up but don’t disturb their time-off vibe.
Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole washroom to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.
MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into
the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors
and peers inside.
WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL’S POV
in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick’s exploits onscreen.
Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.
INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either
side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one
notices Marcel’s actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE
(backward) of Fredrick’s sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE
SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies
like a junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and
pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a
cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?
He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!
FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel’s
ear we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least
sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:
GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we’ll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth
door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly,
stares at him.
He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.
She doesn’t even smile. She says, all serious business:
SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?
FREDRICK
I came to visit you.
SHOSANNA
Can’t you see how busy I am?
FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend an assist.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, it’s not funny. You can’t
be here. This is your premiere. You
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.
FREDRICK
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains, this film
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men. Consequently,
the part of the film
that’s playing now, . . . I don’t like watching
this part.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but—
FREDRICK
—So, I thought I’d come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven’t lost my touch.
DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes
from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.
CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny’s feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi
enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY
ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN
. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE’RE EYE
LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who’s
done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE
THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF
THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge.
As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
(GERMAN)
Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now
pay up.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring
the way.
SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel change.
FREDRICK
Let me do it?
SHOSANNA
No.
FREDRICK
Oh, please, it’s been two years since I’ve done
a reel change.
SHOSANNA
I said, no.
FREDRICK
(cute whine)
Come on, it’s my premiere.
SHOSANNA
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass,
you’ve forgotten what the
word “no” means? No, Fredrick, you
can’t come in here. Now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat than we’ve seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.
FREDRICK
Well, it’s nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it’s just physical pain.
Fredrick steps forward . . .
Shosanna steps backward . . .
FREDRICK
I’m not a man you say “Go away”
to. There’s over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia that, if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me
at your peril.
BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.
SOLDIER’S POV
He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge
from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt
and black tuxedo vest, he’s quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny
walks toward us . . .

Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His
face SCREAMS:
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!!!
The soldier’s GUN is out of its holster and rising toward
Donny’s chest . . .
WHEN . . .
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES
a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising
his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .
The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are
empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened
in front of them.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the
door.
FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick’s back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .
. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to
the floor . . .
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into
the audience . . .
The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her
weapon didn’t stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience . . .
. . . up to the big screen . . .
. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.
The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl’s
heart . . .
. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .
. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .
. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still
ALIVE . . .
Shosanna moves to him . . .
. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .
. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .
. . . He’s holding a LUGER in his hand . . .
. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .
BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
knees to the floor . . .
. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .
. . . FIRES . . .
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .
. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .
Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet
at a time . . .
. . . FIRES . . .
A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .
The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth
floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and
DYING . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring,
informing the projectionist it’s time for the REEL CHANGE.
Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s going
to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel
change.
CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German:
HITLER
Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary.
This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats
his hand.

Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great and painful
effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR . . .

Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle,

ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU
CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (B/W sky),
SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so onscreen Shosanna is looking
down on the Nazis, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE stares
down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells “1984”
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.
HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When
he sees Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s gobsmacked.
BEHIND SCREEN
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the
EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says
in FRENCH:
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I’m interrupting
your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you
dispicable German swine that you’re all going
to die.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
react.
HIRSCHBERG

MARCEL

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
And I want you to look deep in the face of the
Jew who’s going to do it.
AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE
While the shocked German audience is transfixed to the screen,
behind the heads of most of them . . .
The BOMB Landa set in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box . . .
EXPLODES.
BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS HITLER, FRANCESA, and BOORMANN, and
propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theater seat, across the
auditorium, into the opposite wall and taking out a portion
of the ceiling as well.
The crowd reacts . . .
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple
from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the
audience below . . .
ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the
face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!
BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of
nitrate film.
ONSCREEN SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling
little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE
OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA’S FACE
and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .
HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive “Day of the Locust”
SWARM OF BODIES . . .
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
their grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .
Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.
HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar
to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have
on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms,
heads, torsos, and asses.
THEN . . . ,
DONOWITZ’S TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.
COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE
THEATER.
As MADAME MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS . . .
These SUBTITLES APPEAR ONSCREEN as if on a military
teletype:

CUT TO
EXT—WOODS—MORNING
It’s a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German
truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and
Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:
HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members
of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich,
both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.
Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.
Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
the two prisoners.
He does.
COL. LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.
DAGGER.
COL. LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your
prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the
colonel’s hands behind his back.
COL. LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Utivich cuffs the Colonel’s hands behind his back, Aldo
says:
LT. ALDO
I’m a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col. Landa is appalled.
COL. LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal
with your general for that man’s life!
LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t give
a fuck about him, they
need you.
COL. LANDA
You’ll be shot for this.
LT. ALDO
Naw, I don’t think so, more like I’ll
be chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You
know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you
made with the brass. End the war tonight? I’d
make that deal. How ’bout you, Utivich, you
make that deal?
UTIVICH
I’d make that deal.
LT. ALDO
I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
you’re willing to barbecue the whole high
command, I suppose that’s worth certain
considerations. Now I don’t
care about you gettin’ pensions,
merit badges, ticker-tape parades,
who gives a damn, let’s all go home.
But I do have one question.
When you go to your little place on
Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna
take off that handsome-looking S.S.
uniform of yours, ain’t ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn’t respond.
LT. ALDO
That’s what I thought. Now that . . .
. . . I can’t abide. How bout you,
Utivich, can you abide it?
UTIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.
LT. ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you’d wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
our pecker-suckin’ life. But I’m
aware that ain’t practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.
He opens Landa’s S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans’s
face.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give you a little
somethin you can’t take off.
CU COL. LANDA
The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
forehead.
COL. LANDA’S POV
On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
straddles him. And Utivich, who’s next to him. The two
Basterds admire Aldo’s handiwork.
Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:
LT. ALDO
You know somethin’, Utivich? I think this just
might be my masterpiece.
They ghoulishly giggle.

REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:
CHAPTER ONE
“ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .
NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE”
This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:
“1941
One year into the German
occupation of France”
The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings
an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property.
However, simply by sight, you’d never know if he’s been beating at
this stump for the last year or just started today.
JULIE
one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on
the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a
noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:
JULIE’S POV
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in
the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles,
coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.
JULIE
Pappa.
The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his
shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.
The FARMER’S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans
approaching.
The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.
FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash
up with, then get inside with your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out,
splashing into the basin.
The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his
face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a
year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the
windowsill.
JULIE
Ready, Pappa.
FARMER
Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care
of your mother. Don’t run.
Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the
windowsill with the water basin . . .
. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get
LOUDER.
The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don’t move into them but keep observing them from a distance,
like the farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the
door for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:
NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?
NAZI DRIVER
Yes, Herr Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle,
carrying in his left hand a black leather attaché case.
NAZI OFFICER
Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left
alone.
NAZI DRIVER
As you wish, Herr Colonel.
The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH:
NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long
strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:
NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur
LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his
hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.
PERRIER
How may I help you?
COL. LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside your
home and we may have a discussion.
INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY
The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for
the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German
steps inside the Frenchman’s home.
Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer’s
wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen,
smiling in his direction.
The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.
PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of
the French farmer’s wife . . .
COL. LANDA
Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his
hostess’s hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.
FARMER’S WIFE
Don’t be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.
While still holding the French woman’s hand and looking into her
eyes, the S.S. colonel says:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in
the village about your family are all true.
Your wife is a beautiful woman.
His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And each of your daughters is more lovely than
the last.
PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family’s wooden
dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer’s offer
and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the
table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet.
The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:
PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the
Colonel some wine?
COL. LANDA
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in
assuming you have milk?
CHARLOTTE
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.
CHARLOTTE
Very well.
The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.
The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it
down LOUDLY on the wooden table.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I
say: Bravo.
PERRIER
Merci.
COL. LANDA
Please, join me at your table.
PERRIER
Very well.
The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from
the Nazi.
The women remain standing.
Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of
confidentiality:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private. You’ll
notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn’t
offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies
to step outside?
PERRIER
You are right.
PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
The farmer’s wife follows her husband’s orders and gathers her
daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The two men are alone at the farmer’s dinner table, in the farmer’s
humble home.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I’ve
exhausted the extent of my French. To continue
to speak it so inadequately would only serve to
embarrass me. However, I’ve been led
to believe you speak English quite well?
PERRIER
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This
being your house, I ask your permission to
switch to English for the remainder of the
conversation.
PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very familiar with
you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar
with who I am. Are you aware
of my existence?
The farmer answers:
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job I’ve
been ordered to carry out in France?
PERRIER
Yes.
The colonel drinks more milk.
COL. LANDA
Please tell me what you’ve heard?
PERRIER
I’ve heard the Führer has put you in charge of
rounding up the Jews left in France who are
either hiding or passing for gentile.
The S.S. colonel smiles.
COL. LANDA
The Führer couldn’t have said it better
himself.
PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though
it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months
ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
COL. LANDA
I’m aware of that. I read the report on this
area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there’s always a
slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being
a complete waste of time, but it needs to be
done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my
department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attaché case and placing it on the table,
he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive
black fountain pen from his uniform’s front pocket. Opening the
folder and referring to it:
COL. LANDA
Now, before the occupation there were four
Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers
like yourself:
the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins,
and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?
PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers:
COL. LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.
Make yourself comfortable.
The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the
fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
guest.
As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S.
colonel studies the papers in front of him.
COL. LANDA
Now, according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have been
accounted for—except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in
the last year it would appear they have
vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve
either made good their escape
or someone is very successful hiding them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at the
farmer)
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses,
Monsieur LaPadite?
PERRIER
Only rumors—
COL. LANDA
—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where
rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So,
Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard
regarding
the Dreyfuses?
The farmer looks at Landa.
COL. LANDA
Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear
what the rumors are, not who told them to you.
The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.
PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor—but we
heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into
Spain.
COL. LANDA
So the rumors you’ve heard have been of escape?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?
As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards, revealing:
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying horizontally underneath the farmer’s floorboards. These human
beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the
dairy farmer’s house for the past year. But one couldn’t call what
the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has
done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that
wishes to exterminate them.
PERRIER
We were families in the same community, in the
same business. I wouldn’t say
we were friends, but members of the same
community. We had common interests.
The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then
moves to the next question.
COL. LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you
confirm for me the exact members of the
household and their names?
PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her
brother, Bob . . .
COL. LANDA
—How old is Bob?
PERRIER
Thirty—thirty-one?
COL. LANDA
Continue.
PERRIER
And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Ages of the children?
PERRIER
Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna
was fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.
CUT TO
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off
the clothesline.
They can’t hear anything going on inside.
The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.
BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER
COL. LANDA
Well, I guess that should do it.
He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his
attaché case.
The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
COL. LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another glass
of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
But of course.
The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the
carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel’s
glass, the German officer talks.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given me?
PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.
COL. LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?
PERRIER
I’m aware.
COL. LANDA
What are you aware of?
PERRIER
That they call you “the Jew Hunter.”
COL. LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in
repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good people of
Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would
hate the name “the Hangman” is baffling to me.
It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title, precisely because
I’ve earned it.
As “the Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
with the French farmer.
COL. LANDA
The feature that makes me such an effective
hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German
soldiers, I can think like a Jew, where they can
only think like a German or, more precisely, a
German soldier.
Now if one were to determine what attribute the
German people share with a beast, it would be the
cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical
strength—penis size.
But if one were to determine what attributes
the Jews share with a beast, it would
be that of the rat.
Now the Führer and Goebbels’s propaganda have
said pretty much the same thing. Where our
conclusions differ is I don’t consider the
comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the
world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world
indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now, would you greet it with
hostility?
PERRIER
I suppose I would.
COL. LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create
this animosity you feel toward them?
PERRIER
Rats spread disease, they bite people—
COL. LANDA
Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a
practice of biting human beings. Rats were the
cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some
time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever
caused you to be sick a day in your life? I
propose to you, any disease a rat could spread
a squirrel would equally carry.
Yet I assume you don’t share the same animosity
with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
PERRIER
No.
COL. LANDA
Yet they are both rodents, are they
not? And except for the fact that one has a big
bushy tail, while the other has a long
repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather
look alike, don’t they?
PERRIER
It is an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.
COL. LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may be, it
makes not one bit of difference to how you
feel. If a rat were to scamper through your
door this very minute, would you offer it a
saucer of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
Probably not.
COL. LANDA
I didn’t think so. You don’t like them. You
don’t really know why you don’t like them. All
you know is, you find them repulsive.
(lets the
metaphor
sink in)
What a tremendously hostile world a rat must
endure. Yet not only does he survive, he
thrives. And the reason for this is because our
little foe has an instinct for survival and
preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur,
is what a Jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he
would hide. But there are many places it would
never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the
reason the Führer brought me off my Alps in
Austria and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.
Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
(changing tone)
May I smoke my pipe as well?
The farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.
PERRIER
Please, colonel, make yourself at home.
The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped
gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues
to hold court at the Frenchman’s table.
COL. LANDA
The other mistake the German soldiers
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing.
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in wartime.
Let’s use you as a example, Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet
here you are.
So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose
a question. In this time of war, what is
your number-one duty? Is it to fight
the Germans in the name of France to your
last breath? Or is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate
victims of warfare who can
not protect themselves?
Or is your number-one duty in this time
of bloodshed to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
COL. LANDA
That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this
time of war, what do you consider your numberone
duty?
PERRIER
To protect my family.
COL. LANDA
Now, my job dictates that I must have
my men enter your home and conduct a thorough
search before I can officially cross your
family’s name off my list.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And if there are any irregularities to be
found, rest assured, they will be.
That is, unless you have something to tell me
that will make the conducting of a search
unnecessary.
(pause)
I might add also that any information
that makes the performing of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be your family
will cease to be harassed in any way
by the German military during the rest of our
occupation of your country.
The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
opponent.
COL. LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state, are
you not?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
You’re sheltering them underneath your
floorboards, aren’t you?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Point out to me the areas where they’re hiding.
The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses
are underneath.
COL. LANDA
Since I haven’t heard any disturbance,
I assume that while they’re listening, they
don’t speak English?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
I’m going to switch back to French now, and I
want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?
PERRIER
Yes.
Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,
SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and
your hospitality. I do believe our business here
is done.
The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his
men to approach the house.
COL. LANDA
Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We
shan’t be bothering your family any longer.
The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the
area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.
COL. LANDA
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,
I bid you adieu.
He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.
They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS,
SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.
With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their
gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate
silence.
UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS
The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old
SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis’
bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes
for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).
COL. LANDA
hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE
moving forward between the planks in the floor.
COL. LANDA
It’s the girl. Nobody move!
VENT
is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.
COL. LANDA
as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the
cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna

The S.S. colonel closes the window.
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The Nazi town car DRIVES away.
EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY
Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that’s
speeding away from the French farmhouse.
Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?
Out with it?
DRIVER
Why did you allow an enemy of the state to
escape?
COL. LANDA
Oh, I don’t think the state is in too much
danger, do you?
DRIVER
I suppose not.
COL. LANDA
I’m glad you see it my way. Besides,
not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteenyear-
old girl and allowing
her to escape are not necessarily
the same thing. She’s a young girl, no food, no
shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the
massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after
word spreads about what happened today, it’s
highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers
to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I’d say she’ll
probably be turned in by some neighbor.
Or she’ll be spotted by some German soldier. Or
we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from
starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she’ll
survive. She will elude capture. She will escape
to America. She will move to New York City,
where she will be elected President of
the United States.
The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.

CHAPTER TWO
“INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS”
FADE UP
EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY
A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee,
walks down the line. He recruits the men the
Germans will later call “The Basterds.” Lt. Aldo has one
defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his
neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.
The scar will never once be mentioned.
LT. ALDO
My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin’
together a special team.
And I need me eight soldiers.
Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers.
Now y’all might of heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.
Well, we’ll be leavin’ a little
earlier. We’re gonna be dropped
into France, dressed as civilians.
And once we’re in enemy territory, as
a bushwackin’, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be
doin’ one thing, and one thing only—Killin’
Nazis.
The members of the National Socialist Party
have conquered Europe through murder, torture,
intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly
what we’re gonna do to them. Now I don’t know
’bout y’all? But I sure as hell didn’t come
down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross
five thousand miles
of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and
then jump out of a fuckin’ air-o-plane to teach
the Nazis
lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got
no humanity. They’re the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hatin’, mass-murderin’ maniac, and they
need to be destroyed.
That’s why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find
wearin’ a Nazi uniform, they’re gonna die.
LT. ALDO
(CON’T)
We will be cruel to the Germans,
and through our cruelty, they will
know who we are. They will find the evidence of
our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered,
and
disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us. And the Germans
will not be able to help themselves
from imagining the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands, and
our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.
And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the
Germans will talk about us.
And the Germans will fear us.
And when the Germans close their eyes at night
and their subconscious
tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it
will be thoughts of us
that it tortures them with.
He stops pacing and looks at everybody.
LT. ALDO
Sound good?
They all say:
ALL
Yes, sir!
LT. ALDO
That’s what I like to hear. But I
got a word of warning to all would-be warriors.
When you join my command,
you take on debit. A debit you owe
me, personally. Every man under my command owes
me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my
scalps.
And all y’all will git me one hundred
Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of
one hundred dead Nazis . . .
or you will die trying.

INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY
In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with
his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.
They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
HITLER
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure? They butcher my men
like they were fish bait! This pack
of filthy degenerates are doing what
the Russian army didn’t and Patton’s army
couldn’t—turning soldiers of
the Third Reich into superstitious
old women!
GERMAN GENERAL
Just the cowards among them, mein Führer.
Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.
HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich,
who have brought the world to their knees, now
pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know
the latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their
fear-induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call “the Bear
Jew” . . . is a golem.
An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!
GENERAL
Mein Führer, this is just soldiers’ gossip. No
one really believes the
Bear Jew is a golem.
HITLER
Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at
will.
HITLER
(CON’T)
You want to prove they’re flesh and blood? Then
BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their
heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in
the sewers, for the rats of Paris
to feast!
The Führer sits down at the table to compose himself and
wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.
HITLER
(disgusted)
The Bear Jew.
He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.
HITLER
Kliest!
KLIEST’S VOICE comes out of the intercom:
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
I have an order I want relayed to all German
soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as the Bear
Jew henceforth is never to be
referred to as the Bear Jew again.
We will cease to aid the Americans
any longer in their attempt to
undermine the German soldier’s psyche. Did you
get that, Kliest?
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer. Do you still wish
to see Private Butz?
HITLER
Who and what is a private Butz?
KLEIST’S VOICE (OS)
He’s the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine’s Jews. He was its only survivor.
HITLER
Indeed I do want to see him. Thank

His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into
the FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriot’s helmet, and grabs
a handful of the cadaver’s blond hair. A LARGE KNIFE
ENTERS THE FRAME and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a
banana skin.
GERMAN PRISONERS PVT. BUTZ AND SGT. RACHTMAN

Pvt. Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN

Aldo screams to the Basterd who’s guarding the two German
prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut
sarge over.
BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG
KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
You! Go!
Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,
An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he’s ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It’s always been his belief that
only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit
complies with the enemy under threat of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict,
when they put him under the earth,
his dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well, Sergeant, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands
straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his
captor.
SGT. RACHTMAN
(ENGLISH)
Sgt. Werner Rachtman.
Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.
LT. ALDO
Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.
You know what sit down means, Werner?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Then sit down.
The German sergeant does.
LT. ALDO
How’s your English, Werner? Cause if need be,
we gotta couple fellas
can translate.
Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle,
CPL. WILHELM WICKI.
LT. ALDO
Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck
outta Salzberg while the
gettin’ was good. Became American,
got drafted, and came back to give
y’all what for.
Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd,
in a German sergeant’s uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.
LT. ALDO
And another one over there you
might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of ’em?
The two German sergeants look at each other.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Everybody in the German army’s heard
of Hugo Stiglitz.
The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.
NARRATOR (VO)
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s
celebrity among German soldiers
is simple.
WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).
NARRATOR (VO)
As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen
Gestapo officers, mostly
majors.
WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

send him back to Berlin, to be made

Hugo nods.
LT. ALDO
I’m Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are

Hugo nods his head, yes.
LT. ALDO
We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your
work. When it comes to killin’ Nazis, I think
you show great talent, and I pride myself on
havin’ an eye for that kind of talent. But your
status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We
all came here to see if you wanna go pro?
BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.

are?
SGT. RACHTMAN

LT. ADLO
Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably
heard we ain’t in the
prisoner-takin’ business. We in the killin’
Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin’.
The Basterds laugh.
LT. ALDO
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill ya or let ya
go. Now whether or not you gonna
leave this circle alive depends
entirely on you.
Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front
of his prisoner.
LT. ALDO
Up the road a piece, there’s a
orchard. ’Sides you, we know there’s another
kraut patrol fuckin’ around
here somewhere. Now if that patrol
were to have any crack shots, that orchard
would be a goddamn sniper’s delight. Now if you
ever wanna eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
gotta show me on this map where
they are, you gotta tell me how many they are,
and you gotta tell me
what kinda artillery they carrying
with ’em.
SGT. RACHTMAN
You can’t expect me to divulge information that
would put German
lives in danger.
LT. ALDO
Well, Werner, that’s where you’re wrong.
Because that’s exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hidin’
in trees. And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me, right now.
Now take your finger and point out
on this map where this party’s bein’ held, how
many’s comin’, and what they brought to play
with.
Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
inch the German hero facing death.
SGT. WERNER
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.
LT. ALDO
You see that ole boy battin’ rocks?
WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle.
He’s wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones
with a baseball bat.
Werner’s eyes go to the ballplayer.
LT. ALDO
That’s Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know
him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now
if you heard of
Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear
Jew?
SGT. RACHTMAN
I heard.
LT. ALDO
What did you hear?
SGT. RACHTMAN
He beats German soldiers with a club.
LT. ALDO
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat,
what he does.
SGT. DONOWITZ
back to us, still haven’t seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
rock soaring into the atmosphere.
LT. ALDO
Now, Werner, I’m gonna ask you one
last goddamn time, and if you still
“respectfully refuse,” I’m calling the Bear Jew
over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of
his, and he’s gonna beat your ass to death with
it.
Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin’ finger
and point out on this map
what I want to know.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Fuck you and your Jew dogs.
Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.
Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:
LT. ALDO
Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled
ya said that. Frankly, watchin’ Donny beat
Nazis to death is the closest
we ever get to goin’ to the movies.

Mr. Goorowitz watches.
MR. GOOROWITZ

Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:
DONNY

Donny’s “no” silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.
DONNY
Can I try this one on for size, outside?
Extending his arm:
MR. GOOROWITZ
Be my guest.
The phone rings.
MR. GOOROWITZ
I’ll get that. You go right ahead.
The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a
conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.
Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him
clearly through the store’s big picture window.
However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny
to speak with his mother.
Donny starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming
beating somebody to death with it. Then
he starts yelling:
DONNY
Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like
fuckin’ with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews?
The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !
Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his
mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into
the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.
DONNY
Is this the heaviest ya got?
CUT TO
INT—HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING—DAY
Donny, dressed nice, in an apartment building in his Jewish Boston
neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
peering out at the young man.
OLD WOMAN
How can I help you?
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
State your business, young man.
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz.
My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on
Greeny Ave. Sy’s Barber Shop.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I’ve seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?
DONNY
All my life.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Again, state your business?
DONNY
May I have a word with you?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What about?
DONNY
Our people in Europe.
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
young man.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Come in. Would you like some tea?
INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN’S APARTMENT—DAY
Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair,
holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.
DONNY
(sipping tea)
Very good.
MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN
If you like tea.
Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
stone. She wasn’t joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table
and begins:
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones
over in Europe who you’re concerned for?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger
such a personal question?
DONNY
Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna make
it right.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?
He holds up his bat.
DONNY
With this.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And what exactly do you intend to do with that
toy?
DONNY
I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to
death with it.
She takes another sip of tea.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I thought we were having tea together.
Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of
service?
DONNY
I’m going through the neighborhood.
If you have any loved ones in Europe whose
safety you fear for, I’d like
you to write their name on my bat.
BACK TO BASTERDS
Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .
PVT. BUTZ
watches all this . . .
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING,
WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real basterd, Donny.
DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will
join you on this journey.
She signs the BAT: “MADELEINE.”
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:
He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt’s right pocket.
The Jew taps the German’s medal with the end of his bat.
DONNY
You get that for killing jews?
SGT RACHTMAN
Bravery.
Donny gives him a “oh yeah, we’ll see about that,” look.
The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it
down hard against the side of Rachtman’s head.
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
the Basterds.
PVT. BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him:
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
About now, I’d be shittin’ my pants, if I was
you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.
A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.
LT. ALDO
You wanna live?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, sir.
LT. ALDO
Point out on this map the German position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.
PVT. BUTZ
This area here.
LT. ALDO
How many?
PVT. BUTZ
Maybe twelve.
LT. ALDO
What kind of artillery?
PVT BUTZ
They have a machine gun dug in here pointing
north.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
How did you survive this ordeal?
WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Führer’s room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the
Führer, but he seems okay with it.
PVT. BUTZ
They let me go.
FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.
LT. ALDO
Now, when you report what happened here,
you can’t tell ’em you told us what you
told us. They’ll shoot ya. But they’re gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell ’em we let ya live so you
could spread the word through the ranks
what’s gonna happen to every Nazi we find.
HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one
word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got away.
Not one more word.
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
Pause.
HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the other
survivors?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.
LT. ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the
war? When you get back
home, what ’cha gonna do?
PVT. BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I’ve never hugged her
before.
LT. ALDO
Well, ain’t that a real nice boy. Are you going
to take off your uniform?
PVT. BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to
burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants
to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he
thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t like
that. You see, we like our Nazis
in uniforms. That way, you can spot ’em just
like that.
(snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody
gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don’t sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin’ you
can’t take off.
BACK TO HITLER
Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He
moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HANDCARVED
INTO HIS FOREHEAD.
BACK TO BASTERDS
BUTZ’S POV
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All the
Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.
SGT. DONOWITZ
You know, Lieutenant, you’re getting pretty
good at that.
LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t
cha? Practice.
FADE TO BLACK
OVER BLACK
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER THREE
“GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS”
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
We’re in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen.
We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from
the little glass window in the back of the theater.
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and
wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens
of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.
We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German
omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.
The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German
dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .
UNTIL . . .
The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the
movie.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“SHOSANNA DREYFUS
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE
OF SHOSANNA’S FAMILY”
We hear the sound of the German musical’s climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE’S UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their
coats and file out.
EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS
OFF the marquee’s lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO.”
EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema’s projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the
film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.
INT—AUDITORIUM
CU SHOSANNA
Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.
The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman,
who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
one of the cinema’s opera-box balconies.
Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in
the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So, young woman, since it’s beyond obvious we’re
closed for the evening, I must assume you want
something. What can I do for you?
SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?
MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather you’re not a nurse?
SHOSANNA
No.
MADAME MIMIEUX
But you’re a bright little thing. That’s a
clever disguise. Where is your family?
SHOSANNA
Murdered.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you’re a war orphan?
SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—
MADAME MIMIEUX
—Is this a sad story?
SHOSANNA.
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in
Paris has one. I haven’t bored you with mine.
Don’t bore me with yours.
SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?
MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
projector, she says:
SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film.
MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.
Of course I can operate them.
SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.
FLASH ON:
CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
watching . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors . . .
BACK TO SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that
show the film. It’s only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who’ve been put up
against a wall and machinegunned
for sheltering enemies of the state. I
have no intention of being unlucky number
seven. How long have
you been in Paris?
SHOSANNA
A week and a few days.
MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?
SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I’m forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?
SHOSANNA
Cold.
MADAME MIMIEUX
(laughs)
I can imagine.
SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can’t.
Pause.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.
Thinks . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can’t operate a 35mm film projector. You
want me to teach you, in order to work here, in
order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is
that correct?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
What’s your name?
SHOSANNA
Shosanna.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.
DISSOLVE TO
TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
complete with Eiffel Tower.
ABOVE IT READS:
“1944
PARIS”
THEN . . .
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not looking at a TITLE CARD
at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema’s
projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
month is JUNE . . .
The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed
Madame Mimieux’s exceptional test.
A lyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This
will be “Shosanna’s Theme.”
A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors,
alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
she’s projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .
SILVER SCREEN
of the little cinema. Onscreen LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies
horizontal as an icicle drips on her head in the old
German film “The White Hell of Pitz Palu.”
The FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-righthand
corner of the FRAME (that tells the projectionist
to get ready).
As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands
ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .
WHEN . . .
SILVER SCREEN
the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that’s the
one).
SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from
projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As “Shosanna’s Theme” plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via
MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans
up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST’S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU”
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices. Either you
could show new German propaganda films, produced
under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks
out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
girl on top and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at
her from below.
SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a
film as good as “The Kid.” The chase climax of
“The Kid,” superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use an M,
an A, and an X?
SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .
GERMAN SOLDIER
Is it yours?
SHOSANNA
Do I own it?
GERMAN SOLDIER
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl such as yourself own a
cinema?
Due to his uniform and Shosanna’s situation, his efforts
at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.
SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hosting a German night.
SHOSANNA
I don’t have a choice, but you’re welcome.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you choose the German films yourself?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl
mountain films, especially “Pitz Palu.” It’s
nice to see a French girl who’s an admirer of
Riefenstahl.
SHOSANNA
“Admire” would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings toward
Fräulein Riefenstahl.
GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director Pabst, don’t
you? That’s why you included
his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
private.
SHOSANNA
I’m French. We respect directors
in our country.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.
SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
You’re not finished?
SHOSANNA
I’ll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?
SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That’s obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
to read her name.
COL. LANDA
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very
pretty name.
SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.
She gives no response.
GERMAN SOLDIER
It’s been a pleasure chatting with a fellow
cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfewimposed
night.
She looks after him. She didn’t show it, but he kind of got to her.
After all, for any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody
who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.
EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting
up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.
FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist,
Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.
MADAME MIMIEUX
If I ever see you light up a cigarette in my
cinema again, I’ll turn you in to the Nazis, do
you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing an open flame into my cinema,
you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish
boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think
the highest priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning down to
the ground, that’s what!
In my collection, I have over three hundred and
fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not
only immensely flammable but highy unstable.
And should they catch fire, they burn three
times faster than paper. If that happens . . .
POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody
burned alive. If I ever
see you with an open flame in my cinema again,
I won’t turn you into the Nazis. I’ll kill you
myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a
curfew pass.
Do you understand me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.
BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.
MARCEL
Are you well?
SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette
without hearing Madame’s
voice yelling at me. That’s why I
do it. To hear Madame’s voice again.
MARCEL
We both miss her.
SHOSANNA
I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.
INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, “The Saint in New York,” by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine when the young German soldier from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French
girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over
to her. “Oh no, not this guy again,” she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
May I join you?
SHOSANNA
Look, Fredrick—
FREDRICK
(smiling)
—You remember my name?
SHOSANNA
Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow—
FREDRICK
—Merci.
SHOSANNA
You’re welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop
pestering me.
FREDRICK
I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn’t trying to
be a pest. I was simply
trying to be friendly.
SHOSANNA
I don’t wish to be your friend.
FREDRICK
Why not?
SHOSANNA
Don’t act like an infant. You know why.
FREDRICK
I’m more than just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-Germanspeaking
members of the movie’s audience can understand.
He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they
go on their way.
Shosanna’s eyes narrow.
SHOSANNA
Who are you?
FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
You’re not just a German soldier. Are you
somebody’s son?
FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebody’s son.
SHOSANNA
Yeah, but you’re not just somebody. What are
you, Hitler’s nephew?
He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:
FREDRICK
Yes.
SHOSANNA
Really?
FREDRICK
No, not really. I’m just teasing you.
She leans back, annoyed.
SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German movie
star?
FREDRICK
Not exactly.
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) What does that mean, “not exactly”? I
asked if you were a movie star. The answer to
that question is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.
FREDRICK
When you said that just now, you reminded me of
my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.
FREDRICK
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family-operated cinema in Munich.
Seeing you run around your cinema
reminds me of them. Especially my sister
Helga. She raised me, when our father
wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very
much. You’d like her. She doesn’t wear a
German uniform.
SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?
FREDRICK
All my sisters. I’m the baby, but Helga was the
bossiest.
SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?
FREDRICK
My mother died. And my father was a
loser. My father’s motto: “If at first
you don’t succeed, quit.” The day he
left, good riddance. My sisters are
all I need. It’s why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them
and a little homesick at the same time.
SHOSANNA
Is your cinema still operating?
FREDRICK
Oui.
SHOSANNA
What’s it called?
FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.
SHOSANNA
How has it done during the war?
FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.
SHOSANNA
No doubt. You don’t have to operate under a
curfew.
FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) Not since before the war.
FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that would
help you out?
SHOSANNA
Of course, but that’s not likely to happen.
TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table. They ask for Fredrick’s autograph, and he signs it for
them. One of the French girls says, in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that’s it, she thinks.
SHOSANNA
So you’re a war hero? Why didn’t you tell me?
FREDRICK
Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn’t.
SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.
FREDRICK
I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers
in World War Two . . . so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.
SHOSANNA
Wow.
FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled-off city in Russia. It was
myself and a thousand rounds of ammo
in a bird’s nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.
SHOSANNA
What’s a bird’s nest?
FREDRICK
A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call a
bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a
three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very
advantageous for marksmen.
SHOSANNA
How many Russians did you kill?
FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.
(beat)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the second
day. Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received a lot of
attention in Germany. That’s why they all
recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant
York.
SHOSANNA
Maybe they’ll make a film about
your exploits.
FREDRICK
Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride,” and
guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I
did. They have posters for it in kiosks all
over Paris. That’s another reason for all the
attention.
SHOSANNA
“Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s Pride”
is starring you?
FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?
SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?
FREDRICK
Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having my
pictures taken with different German
luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to
premiere in Paris, so I’ve been helping them in
the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He’s telling anybody who will listen that
when “Nation’s Pride” is released
I’ll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna isn’t falling for the young German by any stretch.
However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can’t
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as “Joseph,”
like they’re friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of
things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises and says:
SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I
hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.
EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY
It’s the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
ladder.
WHEN . . .
. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of
the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema.
In French the driver asks Shosanna:
DRIVER
Is this your cinema?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.
DRIVER
Come down, please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to
get in.
SHOSANNA
I don’t understand. What have I done?
DRIVER
(to major)
She wants to know what she’s done?
GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she’s done anything?
DRIVER
Who says you’ve done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux’s arrogant
manner.
SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about, and
where do you propose to take me?
The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.
INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris
streets.
WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.
EXT/INT—MAXIM’S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFÉ)—DAY
She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris café by the
Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she’s not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxim’s. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it:
Germany’s minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler’s
Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and
mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.
TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit
together in another chair at the table.
We join the in mid-conversation:
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
GOEBBELS
—it’s only the offspring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured
in Negro sweat.
Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major.
Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn’t sure whether or not
you’d accept my invitation.
SHOSANNA
Invitation?
THEN . . .
. . . Goebbels’s voice says OFFSCREEN:
GOEBBELS (OS)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.
FREDRICK
Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is
somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons crème brûlée into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister
formally.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce you
to the minister of propaganda, the leader of
the entire German film industry, and now I’m an
actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to
shake. She does.
GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big bite
of tiramisu.
They all laugh.
Frederick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels’s French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.
NARRATOR’S VOICE comes on soundtrack:
NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels’s
French interpreter.
She’s also Goebbels’s favorite French
actress to appear in his films . . . . .
FLASH ON
FRENCH CLIP
from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG
GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can’t help it. My country or my
heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film’s title:
“SENTIMENTAL COMBAT” (1943)
FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet
bed.
NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels’s favorite French mistress, to act
in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGYSTYLE.
FRANCESCA
(animal-like)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!
BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.
FRANCESCA
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
FREDRICK
And you’ve met the major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn’t introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your
service, Mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me. Have a seat.
The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit
down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered
poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small carafe on the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It’s quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.
GOEBBELS
Well, I must say, you’ve made quite an
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels’s German for Shosanna.
GOEBBELS
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch
with my star . . .
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Little do I know he’s become
the toast of Paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, days,
to see me. For the Führer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So finally, I’m granted an audience
with the young private, and he spends the
entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So Fräulein Mimieux, let’s get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts—
FREDRICK
Herr Goebbels, I haven’t informed
her yet.
GOEBBELS
Unless the girl’s a simpleton, I’m
sure she’s figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French:
FRANCESCA
What they’re trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is
Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller’s
film premiere and change the venue to your
cinema.
Zoller reacts.
FRANCESCA
(FRENCH to Zoller)
What?
FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.
FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.
GOEBBELS
(GERMAN to Francesca)
What’s the issue?
FRANCESCA
The young soldier wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:
GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GOEBBELS
How many?
SHOSANNA
Three.
GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?
SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.
GOEBBELS
That’s almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
But Herr Goebbels, that’s not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn’t want to indulge every
two-faced French bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seats it makes the event more
exclusive. You’re not trying to fill
the house, they’re fighting for seats.
FREDRICK
(CON’T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German military, the
High Command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved by
the exploits onscreen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:
GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I’ve created
a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When
the war’s over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.
GOEBBELS
Well, Private, though it is true
I’m inclined to indulge you anything,
I must watch a film in this young
lady’s cinema before I can say
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So, young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight and have
a private screening for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks . . .
SHOSANNA
My cinema, on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks . . . ?
SHOSANNA
I draw an older German audience in
my cinema that appreciates the
nostalgia of an earlier time.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
That’s nonsense, Fräulein. We Germans
are looking forward, not backward.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create will not
only be the cinema of Europe, but
the world’s only alternative to the degenerate
Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is
quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.
GOEBBELS
So it would appear. Unfortunately
for the Fräulein, I’ve outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says:
FREDRICK
Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”?
I’m sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen it.
And it’s so funny. I’ve been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That’s a great idea.
Let’s watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.
GOEBBELS
Ahhh, “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids,”
“Lucky Kids.” When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not
only that, I
wouldn’t be surprised if sixty
years from now, it’s “Lucky Kids”
that I’m the most remembered for.
I know it doesn’t seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I’ll have a print sent
over to the Fräulein’s cinema.
We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.
As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .
the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.
GOEBBELS
Ah, Landa, you’re here. This is the young lady
in question.
The S.S. officer sits down, and it’s our old friend from the
first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of
the S.S. He’ll be running security
for the premiere.
CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it,
saying in perfect French:
COL. LANDA
Charmed, Mademoiselle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as “the Jew Hunter.”
The table laughs.
GOEBBELS
Oh, Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Führer said about Hans?
FRANCESCA
What thing?
GOEBBELS
You know, you were there. It was a
funny thing the Führer said,
about Hans . . . something about a pig?
Francesca’s memory is jogged.
FRANCESCA
Oh, yes, of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels’s ear.
GOEBBELS
Oh, yes, of course, that’s it. So
the Führer said he wouldn’t be
surprised if Hans weren’t rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the playpen.
FRANCESCA
That’s what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.
COL. LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big, hearty laugh around the table.
GOEBBELS
Do you have an engagement tonight?
COL. LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do—
GOEBBELS
—Break it. We’re all going to the fräulein’s
cinema tonight to view
“Lucky Kids.”
COL. LANDA
Splendid.
Then the Reich minister’s companion, Mademoiselle Mondino,
interrupts:
FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to
his next appointment.
GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .
As Col. Landa stands, he says:
COL. LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion, I’m
afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle
Mimieux.
Mademoiselle Mimieux’s eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.
FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?
COL. LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like
a soldier questioning the order of a colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?
FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth, Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation precedes
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?
GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s
simply smitten. And he’s correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make
their way to front of the café, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.
COL. LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue’s property owner.
FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream
and walk along the Seine another
time. Right now, allow Col. Landa
to do his job.
Everybody says their farewells.
Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxim’s.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter’s
French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at
French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film’s first scene was
simply an interrogation technique.
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?
SHOSANNA
No.
COL. LANDA
It’s not so terrible. So how is it
the young private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She’s about to answer when a WAITER approaches.
COL. LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of
steamed milk on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last
time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her
entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
least . . . disconcerting.
The key to Col. Landa’s power and/or charm, depending on the
side one’s on, lies in his ability to convince you he’s privy to
your secrets.
The waiter exits.
COL. LANDA
So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain . . . ?
SHOSANNA
(anxiously)
Up until a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller
or his exploits. To me, the private
was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke
a few times, but—
COL. LANDA
—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a
simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The strudel arrives.
The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:
COL. LANDA
I apologize. I forgot to order the
crème fraîche.
WAITER
One moment.
He exits.
COL. LANDA
(referring to
the crème.)
Wait for the crème
(back to
business)
So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
COL. LANDA
So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen that a young lady
such as yourself comes to own a
cinema?
The waiter returns, applying crème fraîche to the two strudels.
The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking
up his fork, he says:
COL. LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her
lead.
COL. LANDA
(mouthful
of strudel)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.
COL. LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(back to
business)
So you were explaining the origin of your
cinema ownership?
SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle—
Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.
COL. LANDA
—What are their names?
SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.
COL. LANDA
Where are they now?
SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.
COL. LANDA
Pity . . . Continue.
SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.
COL. LANDA
Regrettable.
(respectful
pause)
It’s come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ. Is that true?
SHOSANNA
Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He
worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He’s the only other one who works
with me.
COL. LANDA
Doing what?
SHOSANNA
Projectionist.
COL. LANDA
Is he any good?
SHOSANNA
The best.
COL. LANDA
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
SHOSANNA
Of course I can.
COL. LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I’m quite positive he wouldn’t want
the success or failure of his illustrious
evening dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass that we hold this event
at your venue—talented, no doubt,
as your negro may be—you will
operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?
As if she has any say.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows
suit.
COL. LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is quite
smitten with you?
SHOSANNA
Private Zoller’s feelings for me
aren’t of a romantic nature.
COL. LANDA
Mademoiselle . . . ?
SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.
COL. LANDA
That doesn’t mean his feelings
aren’t romantic.
SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.
COL. LANDA
It’s sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S.
LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy
S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Cigarette?
SHOSANNA
No, thank you.
COL. LANDA
Do you smoke?
SHOSANNA
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one. They’re not
French, they’re German.
I hope you’re not nationalist about
your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a
sin against nicotine.
She takes one but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deeply and says:
COL. LANDA
I did have something else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can’t remember what it is. Oh,
well, must not have been important.
Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts
on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting
Shosanna, and says:
COL. LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he’s gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and
ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
During her conversation and strudel with the man who
exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her
feet.
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
Onscreen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS.”
We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.
CU GOEBBELS
watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.
CU FRANCESCA
laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.
CU TWO BLACK POODLES
pantingly watching the screen.
CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
smiling, smoking a German cigarette.
CU COL LANDA
smoking a German cigarette, amused.
CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
truly enjoying himself.
CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.
NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel’s
Frank Capra copy “Lucky
Kids,” a thought suddenly comes to her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.
NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose
its minister of
propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew
hunter, all in one fell swoop.
She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she’s
chuckling at the German comedy.
NARRATOR (VO)
But then that thought . . .
. . . led Shosanna
To a crazy idea.
The idea flashes on her face.
Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.
Zoller looks over at her. Happy.
She’s enjoying the movie.
SILVER SCREEN
“The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is projected.
The Nazi rouges’ gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.
The lights go up.
Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
file out into the lobby.
NARRATOR (VO)
The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a complete
success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the
venue changed
to Shosanna’s cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had
an idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:
GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your cinema
has real respect, almost churchlike.
Not to say we couldn’t spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there’s a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. We’re going to get it
and hang it from the very middle of
the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the
Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.
MONTAGE
We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous
crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
into place.
We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge,
heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna’s auditorium,
which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s Italian
B-movie ripoffs of Visconti’s “The Damned.”
SHOSANNA
watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in
disbelief.
BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS
in the lobby, post screening of “Lucky Kids.” She’s soundlessly
escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.
NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy . . .
We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.
NARRATOR (VO)
None more so than Fredrick Zoller.
She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into
Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look
like grotesque Nazi caricatures.
The Nazis are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down
at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
What the fuck are we supposed to do?
SHOSANNA
It looks like we’re supposed to have
a Nazi premiere.
MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to
do?
SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.
MARCEL
About what?
SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.
MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna
has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.
SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching that Boche
(said in
English)
Capra-corn abomination,
(back to
French)
I got an idea.
MARCEL
I’m confused. What are we talking
about?
SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazis and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.
MARCEL
I’m not talking about that. You’re talking
about that.
SHOSANNA
No, we’re talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.
MARCEL
Shosanna—
SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we
wanted to burn down the cinema
for any number of reasons, you and I could
physically accomplish that, no?
MARCEL
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux’s three hundred and fifty
nitrate film print collection,
we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?
MARCEL
You mean we wouldn’t need any more explosives?
SHOSANNA
Oui, that’s exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which
I am, we both know
you’re not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both
caresses and grips her lovely neck.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And you’re the only person on this earth I can
trust.
She then TWISTS around so she’s straddling him. They are now
face to face.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the
filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I
know the film
camera does. How about the sound recorder?
MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a café last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?
SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazis.
She gives him a deep French kiss.
FADE TO BLACK
BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FOUR
“OPERATION KINO”
FADE OFF
INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHÉ opens the sliding double doors
that serve as an entrance to the room.
MILITARY ATTACHÉ
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside
the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,
a young George Sanders type (“The Saint” and “Private Affairs of
Bel Ami” years).
Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind
GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type (“Village of the
Damned”).
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable
bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.
The lieutenant was not expecting him.
Hicox salutes the general.
LT. HICOX
Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.
GEN. FENECH
(salutes back)
General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?
Hicox’s eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
who’s scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind
the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment
of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox
knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn’t introduced, he ain’t
there.
LT. HICOX
If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I
could drink a scotch and
plain water.
GEN. FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like
a good chap,
will you? Bar’s in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.
LT. HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?
GEN. FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and
busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant’s file.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you’ve run three
undercover commando operations in Germany and
German-occupied
territories? Frankfurt, Holland,
and Norway, to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:
LT. HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?
LT. HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
GEN. FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends . . .
LT. HICOX
I’m a film critic.
GEN. FENECH
List your accomplishments?
LT. HICOX
Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews
and articles for a publication called “Films
and Filmmakers.”
As well as our sister publication.
GEN. FENECH
What’s that called?
LT. HICOX
“Flickers Bi-Monthly,” and I’ve had
two books published.
GEN. FENECH
Impressive. Don’t be modest, Lieutenant. What
are their titles?
LT. HICOX
The first book was called “Art of the Eyes, the
Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema
in the Twenties.”
And the second one was called . . .
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general’s
whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.
LT. HICOX
“Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.”
It’s a subtextual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G. W. Pabst.
He hands the general his whiskey.
LT. HICOX
What should we drink to, sir?
GEN. FENECH
(thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.
LT. HICOX
All the way down, sir.
CLINK.
GEN. FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema under the
Third Reich?
LT. HICOX
Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.
GEN. FENECH
Explain it to me.
LT. HICOX
Pardon, sir?
GEN. FENECH
This little escapade of ours
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to
me UFA, under Goebbels?
LT. HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he’s
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema—an alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the twenties and
the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:
CHURCHILL
How’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?
CHURCHILL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to, say,
. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn’t
be Goebbels’ proper opposite number. I believe
Goebbels sees himself closer to David O.
Selznick.
Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:
CHURCHILL
Brief him.
GEN. FENECH
Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I’d like to
brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from
now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—
LT. HICOX
—What film, sir?
The general has to resort to peeking at his file.
GEN. FENECH
The motion pictures called “Nation’s Pride.”
LT. HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?
GEN. FENECH
We don’t have any intelligence on exactly what
the film that night
will be about.
LT. HICOX
But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?
GEN. FENECH
Yes.
LT. HICOX
I can tell you what it’s about.
It’s about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He’s the German Sargeant York.
Fenech can’t help suppress a smile. They have the right man.
GEN. FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion
will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most
of the German High Command, including all the
high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the
Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi
propaganda-film industry.
LT. HICOX
The master race at play, aye?
GEN. FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation
Kino . . . Blow up the basket.
LT. HICOX
(reciting a
poem)
. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone
from this earth. Jolly good, sir.
GEN. FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist. The Germans call them “the
Basterds.”
LT. HICOX
“The Basterds.” Never heard of them.
GEN. FENECH
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them
the devil. Their leader is a chap
named Lieutenant Aldo Raine. The
Germans call him “Aldo the Apache.”
LT. HICOX
Why do they call him that?
GEN. FENECH
Best guess is because he removes the scalps of
the Nazi dead.
LT. HICOX
Scalps, sir?
GEN. FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.
GEN. FENECH
Like a red Injun.
LT. HICOX
Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird,
isn’t he?
GEN. FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But
you’ve heard the
expression “It takes a thief.”
LT. HICOX
Indeed.
Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
to a military map.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four
kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will
be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a
little village called Nadine.
(He points it out
on the map.)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there’s a tavern called
La Louisiane. You’ll rendezvous
with our double agent, and she’ll take it from
there. She’s the one who’s
going to get you into the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two Germanborn
members of the Basterds. She’s
also made all the other arrangements you’re
going to need.
LT. HICOX
How will I know her?
GEN. FENECH
I suspect that won’t be too much
trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von
Hammersmark.
LT. HICOX
Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star
is working for England?
GEN. FENECH
For the last two years now. One could even say
Operation Kino was her brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks:
CHURCHILL
Extraordinary woman.
LT. HICOX
Quite.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She’ll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?
LT. HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.
EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema
literally making a movie.
Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
positioned low, looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
into it.
A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what.
MARCEL
We need a sync mark.
SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?
MARCEL
An action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.
SHOSANNA
How do we do that?
MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.
MARCEL
In frame, imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.
MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:
SHOSANNA
Ready.
MARCEL
Action.
WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .
THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE
LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big difference. This time, it’s in COLOR.
MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop
that footage. How do we get
a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?
MARCEL
Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,
took care of all the experimental filmmakers.
But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what you’re talking about. If the
Nazis found out, their life wouldn’t
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.
SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you either eat the
wolf or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to
obliterate the Nazis,
we have to use their tactics.
MARCEL
What does that mean?
SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print. And we
make them do it or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway or they’ll turn us in.
MARCEL
Would you do that?
SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.
INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT
A old mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties.
Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING
at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.
SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel holds Gaspar’s arm behind him as he forces his head flat
against the tabletop.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
his face.
SHOSANNA
You either do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I’ll bury this ax in your
collaborating skull.
GASPAR
I’m not a collaborator!
SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do
his wife and children
know you?
MARCEL
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we’ll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .
SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!
CUT TO
GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside
the shop window, it’s morning.
INT—PROJECTION ROOM
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller’s
life story, “Nation’s Pride” (clearly marked), on the floor of
the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.
Shosanna’s at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the
rewinds . . .
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel’s footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick’s
film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.
BLACK FRAME
FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out
front that reads “La Louisiane.”
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“The village of
Nadine, France”
TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
German gray S.S. captain’s uniform. They look out of a window, in
an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.
LT. ALDO
You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a
fuckin’ basement.
LT. HICOX
I didn’t know.
LT. ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?
LT. HICOX
It is a tavern.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin’ in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being
you’re fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant’s
uniform.
WICKI
What if we go in there and she’s
not even there?
LT. HICOX
We wait. Don’t worry. She’s a British spy.
She’ll make the rendezvous.
WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray
uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his
boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd’s opening
chapter is dead.
Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the
room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.
Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .
Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz, right?
STIGLITZ
That’s right, sir.
He continues bringing the blade’s edge up, then down on the leather
strap.
LT. HICOX
I hear you’re pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade.
Stiglitz doesn’t answer.
LT. HICOX
You know, we’re not looking for
trouble right now. We’re simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I’m wrong and things prove
eventful, I need to know we can all remain
calm.
The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade’s progress and
looks up at the limey lieutenant.
STIGLITZ
I don’t look calm to you?
LT. HICOX
Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:
LT. HICOX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.
LT. ALDO
Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious
type?
LT. HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.
LT. ALDO
So y’all git in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
LT. HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans or French, for that matter—
escape from that basement.
If Fräulein von Hammersmark’s cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.
Donny chimes in:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Speaking of Fräulein von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?
LT. HICOX
She chose the spot.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Well, isn’t that just dandy?
LT. HICOX
Look, she’s not a military strategist. She’s
just an actress.
LT. ALDO
Ya don’t got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don’t want to
fight in a basement.
LT. HICOX
She wasn’t picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin’ on
Louisiana two o’clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.
LT. HICOX
Shit.
Sgt. Donowitz chides him:
SGT. DONOWITZ
So what do you think your Fräulein
von Hammer—
LT. HICOX
—Obviously, I don’t know, Sergeant.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who’s not
supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
in hand.
STIGLITZ
If we’re going, let’s go.
He sheaths the dagger.
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task.
Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .
INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging
basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the
only other space in the little tavern is taken
up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both
halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the
two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
five.
FIVE NAZIS
ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a
powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.
The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and
playing a very fun game with none other than the Fräulein of
the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the
nines in a chic, forties-style woman’s suit, complete with fedora.
The game they’re playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
stuck to their forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is
on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
out who they are.
The five Germans’ five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);
FEMALE SGT #2: (BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);
GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5:
(WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It’s German #5’s (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
WINNETOU
. . . okay, I’m not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN
Yes, you are!
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, if he’s so American, how come
he’s never been translated into
English. He’s not American. He’s supposed to be
American, but he’s not
an American creation. In fact, he’s something
very different.
WINNETOU
Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character, from
the past. I’m American, and that’s
controversial.
BRIDGET/GENGUS
No, it’s not controversial. The nationality of
the author has nothing to do with
the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet’s not British, he’s Danish.
So, yes, this character was born in
America.
WINNETOU
Well, I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a wife,
would she be called a squaw?
He’s got it.
The table laughs.
THE TABLE
YES!
WINNETOU
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
THE TABLE
Yes!
WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?
THE TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German
officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement
tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they’re
too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No
doubt they’re less than happy. Fräuhlein von Hammersmark
sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.
BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies. I will join you
in moments. I’m finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.
LT. HICOX
No hurry, Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Take your time. Enjoy yourself.
BRIDGET
(to Winnetou)
So who are you?
WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card
off his forehead.
The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of
the game).
Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.
MATA HARI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, when your friends
came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the movies?
BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that
at all.
MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now. Did they
teach you how to do a double take in the
movies?
BRIDGET
Well, yes, they did, but it’s not really that
difficult.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The table heartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, double take.
The table loves it.
MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double
take.
EDGAR WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.
HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don’t
understand.
THEN . . .
Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the
table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.
BRIDGET
Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.
She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans’ table. The
gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek
kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey.
The tavern’s PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more
champagne into Bridget’s champagne glass. He leaves, returning back
behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
LT. HICOX
I thought this place was supposed to have more
French than Germans?
BRIDGET
Normally that’s true. The sergeant over there’s
wife just had a baby. His commanding officer
gave him and his
mates the night off to celebrate.
WICKI
We should leave.
BRIDGET
No, we should stay. For one drink at least.
I’ve been waiting for you in a bar. It would
look strange if we left before we had a drink.
LT. HICOX
She’s right. Just be calm, and enjoy your
booze.
BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French barmaid has taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy
game. She tells them her person must be French or she
won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:
NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS’ TABLE
BRIDGET
There’s been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.
LT. HICOX
Why?
BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t be a
problem. The cinema
it’s been changed to is considerably smaller
than The Ritz. So whatever materials you
brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective
here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to overreact.
The Führer will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.
Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing.
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they
did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
get wet.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
BRIDGET
(to Hicox)
You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll say
you’re an associate producer on Riefenstahl’s
“Tiefland.” It’s the
one German production not under Goebbels’
control, and Leni wouldn’t be caught dead at a
Goebbels film affair.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily,
at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in
the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and
head toward Fräulein von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
. . . the film’s gone through many delays, and
Leni’s health is deteriorating, so if you have
to speak . . .
Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her
to cool it.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking,
could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?
BRIDGET
I’d love to, Wilhelm.
(to the table)
This handsome happy sergeant just became a
father today.
The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.
The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his
superior officers.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you. Heil Hitler.
He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: “Heil
Hitler.”
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .
BRIDGET
So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this
progeny yet?
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, Fräulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.
STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sergeant.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old enough to
ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side “The Blue Max.”
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.
BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I’m not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick,
applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the
napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured
item to the young officer.
BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Fräulein, thank you. Max may not
know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in
Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no
Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his
table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is
drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
So, Fräulein von Hammersmark, what brings you
to France?
Feeling any good Nazi officer’s patience would have been
exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.
LT. HICOX
None of your business, Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with
the fräulein with your drunken, boorish
behavior, but you have worn out your welcome
with me.
The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.
LT. HICOX
Might I remind you Sergeant, you’re an enlisted man.
This is an officers’ table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fräulein and
rejoin your table.
The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very
unusual.
The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two Germanborn
imposters spring into action.
WICKI
Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to
speak to a superior officer with
such impertinence!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:
STIGLITZ
I’m making YOU . . .
(pointing at
Winnetou)
. . . and YOU . . .
(pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
. . . responsible for him.
(pointing at
Sgt. Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or
he’ll spend Max’s first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!
The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .
WHEN . . .
A GERMAN VOICE rings out:
GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German
in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:
MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from
the little table he was sitting at.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young, newly christened father, I to
have an acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Wicki jumps in:
WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—I wasn’t speaking to you,
Lieutenant Saltzberg,
(turning to
Stiglitz)
or you either, Lieutenant Berlin.
(looking at
Hicox)
I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.
The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the
imposter’s table.
Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.
LT. HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Pitz Palu.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?
LT. HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.
LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch
scene?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes, I do.
LT. HICOX
In that scene were myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is
so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a
closeup.
As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette
holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her
she says:
BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch
for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he
was in the film, and his brother is far more
handsome than he.
The imposters laugh.
Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table
begins playing their game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows
graciously to the female German celebrity.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?
BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki.
The French barmaid brings over the Major’s beer stein.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that’s the source of your bizarre accent?
Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here, Captain?
LT. HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fräulein?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle . . . chuckle
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. You’re obviously not
stationed in France, or I’d know who
you are.
LT. HICOX
You know every German in France?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Worth knowing.
LT. HICOX
Well, therein lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?
LT. HICOX
Attending Goebbels’s film premiere as
the fräulein’s escort.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You’re the fräulein’s escort?
LT. HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
BRIDGET
The captain is my date, but all three are my
guests. We’re old friends, Major, who go back a
long time. Longer than
an actress would care to admit.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.
BRIDGET
I’ll drink to that.
They cheers.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS’ TABLE
They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.
BACK TO THE OFFICERS’ TABLE
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game they’re playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t
join them, because you’re quite right, Captain,
officers and enlisted men shouldn’t
fraternize. But seeing as we’re all
officers here,
(bowing to
Bridget)
. . . and sophisticated lady friends of
officers, what say we play the game?
Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better)
interrupts him:
BRIDGET
Okay, one game.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Wunderbar.
The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game is to write
the name of a famous person on your card. Real
or fictitious, doesn’t matter. For instance,
you could write Confucius or
Fu Manchu.
(He SNAPS his fingers.)
Eric! More pens.
(back to the players)
And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When
you finish writing, put the card face down on
the table and move it to the person to your
left. The person to your right will move their
card in
front of you. You pick up the card without
looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on
your forehead, like so.
He demonstrates.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(con’t)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess
who you are . . .
As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
STIGLITZ. The major’s dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Until we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED
FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a
GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.
The flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being
this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into
it.
The major’s voice comes back on the soundtrack.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
. . . So let’s give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The five players write their names . . .
Then move their cards to the left . . .
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .
MAJOR BRIDGET WILHELM ARCHIE HUGO
HELLSTROM VON HAMMERSMARK WICKI HICOX STIGLITZ
is is is is is
KING G.W. BULLDOG BRIGITTE MARCO
KONG PABST DRUMMOND HELM POLO
MAJ. KING KONG
I’ll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
They laugh.
BRIDGET
No.
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I an American?
They laugh—but then Wicki says:
WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to—
BRIDGET
Don’t be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn’t born
in America.
MAJ. KING KONG
So . . . I visited America, aye?
The table says, “Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Was this visit . . . fortuitous?
WICKI
Not for you.
MAJ. KING KONG
. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one
would call exotic?
The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.
MAJ. KING KONG
Hummm. That could be either a reference to the
jungle or the Orient. I’m going to let my first
instinct take over and ask, am I from the
jungle?
The table says, “Yes, you are.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask
whether you’re real or fictitious.
I, however, think that’s too easy, so I won’t
ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the
jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not
fortuitous to me, but the implication is that
it was to somebody else. When I went from the
jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed
in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The table says, “No.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Well, then, I must be King Kong.
He throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to
finish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who’s next?
LT. HICOX
Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the four of
us are very good friends. And the four of us
haven’t seen each other in quite a while. So .
. .
Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ, Captain. It’s only if the
fräulein considers my presence an
intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein? Am I intruding?
BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn’t think so. It’s simply the young
captain is immune to my charms.
The table’s not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation?
Then the major laughs.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I’m just joking. Of course, I’m intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and
I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
(leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old
single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish
highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?
LT. HICOX
You’re most gracious, sir.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You
don’t want to contaminate the thirty-three with
the swill you were drinking.
ERIC
How many glasses?
LT. HICOX
Five glasses.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn’t like me.
BRIDGET
Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly.
Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric,
the owner.
LT. HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for
the three soldiers.
Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:
MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand-year Reich!
They all mutter, “a thousand-year reich” and clink glasses.
The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
CLICK under the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That’s the sound of
my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.
LT. HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you’ve just given yourself
away, captain. You’re no more German than
scotch.
LT. HICOX
Well, Major—
BRIDGET
—Major—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—Shut up, slut.
(to Hicox)
You were saying?
LT. HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve had a
gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
SGT. STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.
UNDER THE TABLE
We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well
as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi major’s. Her pretty
gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.
SGT. STIGLITZ
And at this range, I’m a real
Fredrick Zoller.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.
LT. HICOX
What’s going to happen, Major, is you’re going
to stand up and walk out that
door with us.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don’t think so. I’m
afraid you and I both know, no matter what
happens to anybody else in this room, the two of
us aren’t going anywhere.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing at the table
behind him)
Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.
If any of you expect to live, you’ll have to shoot
them too.
(pause)
Looks like little Max is going to grow up an
orphan. How sad.
BRIDGET
Then, Major, I implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops
gets me . . .
(pointing at
his heart)
. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your
whore legs, don’t you? You can’t afford to get
any bullet holes in them. You’re not finished
spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt
scotch and says:
LT. HICOX
(ENGLISH)
Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope
you don’t mind if I go out speaking
the king’s?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
By all means, Captain.
The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three
the Nazi major bought him and says:
LT. HICOX
There’s a special rung in hell reserved for
people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily . . .
He downs the stuff.
LT. HICOX
(to the Nazi
major)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
He puts the glass down.
LT. HICOX
Now about this pickle we find
ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one
thing left for you to do.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz.
STIGLITZ
Say, “auf Widersehen” to your balls!
STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS . . .
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
well.
HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX’s BALLS and KNEECAPS.
STIGLITZ
then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the
DAGGER.
HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.
WICKI
brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS
FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still
PLAYING THE GAME.
WINNETOU
is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.
EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each
other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS
it’s almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the
floor.
WICKI and MATA HARI
both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is
HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the
whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI,
and THE BARMAID.
The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . .
starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is
the
young German sergeant with the machine gun.
WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement
entrance.
The door opens . . .
The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door’s
direction . . .
No one goes through it.
What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one
inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.
The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:
GERMAN SERGEANT
You outside! Who are you? British, American,
what?
Aldo’s voice YELLS down the hole:
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
We’re Americans! What are you?
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a German, you idiot!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
You speak English pretty good for a German!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I agree! So let’s talk!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, talk!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max!
We were in here drinking and celebrating!
They’re the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It’s not my fault!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!
What’s your name, soldier?
GERMAN SERGEANT
Wilhelm!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
That’s the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!
WILHELM
They attacked us!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive
on our side?
WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:
BRIDGET’S VOICE (OS)
I’m alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.
On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive
Bridget von Hammersmark.
The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at
the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Who’s that?
WILHELM
(to BRIDGET,
low)
Make a sound, whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?
WILHELM
Is the girl on your side?
Pause.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Which girl?
WILHELM
Who do you think—von Hammersmark!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Yeah, she’s ours!
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the Americans
now, huh? Now times are
bad?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Is she okay?
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(to Aldo)
She’s been shot, but she’s alive.
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm, what’d ya say we
make a deal?
WILHELM
What’s your name?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?
WILHELM
Yes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four
or five or six grenades down there and your
little war story ends here. But good fer you,
bad fer her.
You die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?
WILLI
Keep talking!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Willi, here’s my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little Max
gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy!
So what ‘ya say, Willi, we got a deal?
Willi thinks . . .
Bridget watches Willi think . . .
WILLI
Aldo?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
I’m here, Willi!
WILLI
I want to trust you . . . But how can I?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
What choice ya got?
WILLI
I could kill the girl!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Well, now, Willi, that’s true enough. But
something you need to know, so
you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t
none of us give a fuck ‘bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be
dead by then anyway, so
what’d you care? And let’s not
forget that little Katzenjammer
Max, growin’ up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin’ you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?
WILLI
Okay, Aldo. I’m going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.
Aldo, with his hands up, says:
ALDO
Hey, Willi, what’s with the machine
gun? I thought we had a deal.
WILLI
We do have a deal. Now get the girl
and go.
ALDO
Not so fast, Willi. We only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff
ain’t trust.
WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican standoff.
ALDO
You got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we’re dead. Up top, they got grenades,
they drop ’em down here, you’re dead. That’s a
Mexican
standoff, and that wasn’t the deal.
WILLI
Just take that fuckin’ traitor and
go! See? Now you’re down here—
Now you get tricky—!
ALDO
—No tricks!—Ain’t nobody gittin’
tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I’m
too damn dumb to get tricky. But
(meaning
Hirschberg)
him and I lived up to the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it’s
your turn. No trust, no deal.
Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .
ALDO
I know you’re scared. I’m scared,
he’s scared, we’re all scared.
So what’s it gonna be, Willi?
Either we got a deal or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides . . .
He puts the machine gun down on the bar.
WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.
ALDO
Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab
her shoulder—
WHEN . . .
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom’s
WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain
(she’ll probably lose that leg} German movie star says to the
two American soldiers she’s just meeting for the first time:
BRIDGET
He was an enemy soldier who knew who
I was. He couldn’t live.
INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT
An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
bed, in his bedroom . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . . OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .
. . . . . The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING . . .
and the sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .
his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES
IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a
.45 automatic to his head.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Doctor?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
What? What’s happening?
Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man’s head, shocking,
scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Andiamo . . .
Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost
comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
against him hurts more) toward the door . . .
INT—DOCTOR’S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
. . . Into a doctor’s examining room built into a French country
house, with an examining table and medical instruments.
However, it’s obviously the medical examining room
of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING
dogs in them.
The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in
excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl’s
direction . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
She’s been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .
(pointing at
his leg)
. . . in leg . . . understand?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
No, no, no, I don’t speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!
The old man nods his head, yes.
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
But I’m a veterinarian . . . animals . . .
I take care of animals . . .
Bridget screams from the table . . .
BRIDGET
(ENGLISH)
He’s a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!
SGT. DONOWITZ
He’s still a doctor. If he can get
a bullet out of a cow, he can get
a bullet outta you.
LT. ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The old man tries to explain in French that he’s not a human doctor
. . .
Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
BANG
He SHOOTS another dog . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.
CUT TO
The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.
INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT
We’re back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands
over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile
breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Ahhh, Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world, I
see. Lieutenant. And with
your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.
COL. LANDA
And that one’s . . .
(pointing at
Wicki)
. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He’s an Austrianborn
Jew who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites. They are
the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They’ve been known
to don German uniforms to ambush squads.
FLASH ON
three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German
soldiers. The three soldiers’ back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet
holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:
SGT. GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
But that doesn’t look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he sees something . . .
Bending down, he examines Fräulein von Hammersmark’s two
pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.
COL. LANDA
It would appear somebody’s missing. Somebody
fashionable.
AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out:
SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)
Colonel, this one’s still alive!
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He’s
shot in the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.
INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
German lady.
LT. ALDO
Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need
to answer a few questions.
BRIDGET
Few questions about what?
LT. ALDO
About I got three men dead back there, and why
don’t you try tellin’ us what the fuck
happened?
BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo major saw it.
LT. ALDO
’Fore we get into who shot John,
Why did you invite my men to a
rendezvous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?
BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn’t see
what happened inside, the Nazis
being there must look odd.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English. It’s called
suspicious.
BRIDGET
Don’t let your imagination get the better of
you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His
commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
Aldo thinks for a moment . . .
LT. ALDO
Okay, I’ll buy that. He was either
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
son’s birthday. He wasn’t doin’ both.
LT. ALDO
How did the shootin’ start?
BRIDGET
The English man gave himself away.
LT. ALDO
How did he do that?
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.
BRIDGET
This is the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would and did notice it.
LT. ALDO
Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans, and
everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to. What would of been
the next step?
BRIDGET
Tuxedoes. To get them into the
premiere wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
have been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody
else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedoes tonight.
LT. ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?
BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the
film premiere.
BRIDGET
Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman
and his assistant.
LT. ALDO
Can you still get us into that
premiere?
BRIDGET
Can you speak German better than your friends?
No. Have I been shot? Yes.
I don’t see me tripping the light fantastic up
the red carpet anytime
soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.
(pause)
However, there’s something you don’t know.
There’s been two recent developments regarding
Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz to a much
smaller venue.
LT. ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s not
very Germanic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin’ stuff so damn peculiar?
BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.
LT. ALDO
Which is?
FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler,
aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner
with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
THE FUHRER
(GERMAN)
I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to
your Paris premiere of “Nation’s Pride.” As the
weeks have
gone on and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous
for us. And I’m beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.
BACK TO BRIDGET
BRIDGET
The Führer’s attending the premiere.
Donny breaks the team’s silence:
SGT. DONOWITZ
What?
LT. ALDO
When the hell did this happen?
BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Führer’s attendance, four days
ago.
LT. ALDO
And how come London don’t know
nothing about that?
BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London knows, it
learned from me. If I
don’t know, London doesn’t know.
So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s
coming to Paris.
SGT. DONOWITZ
FUCK A DUCK!
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
information.
BRIDGET
What are you thinking?
LT. ALDO
I’m thinking getting a wack at
plantin’ ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.
BRIDGET
What’s that supposed to mean?
LT. ALDO
It means you’re gettin’ us into that premiere.
BRIDGET
I’m going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye, acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?
LT. ALDO
The doggie doc’s gonna dig that slug outta your
gam. Then he’s gonna wrap
it up in a cast, and you gotta good
“how I broke my leg mountain climbing” story.
That’s German, ain’t it?
Y’all like climbin’ mountains,
don’t cha?
BRIDGET
I don’t. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.
LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it’s comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.
BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a
wall, it won’t hurt
so much.
(changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
Americans speak any other language
than English?
HIRSCHBERG
Other than Yiddish?
BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:
SGT. DONOWITZ
We both speak a little Italian.
BRIDGET
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn’t exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don’t have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and
brazen through it, is
that the plan?
LT. ALDO
That’s about it.
BRIDGET
That sounds good.
LT. ALDO
It sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?
BRIDGET
No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it
with that, I can get you in the building.
(changes tone)
So, who does what?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak the most Italian, so
I’ll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he’ll be your Italian
cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he’ll be Donny’s assistant.
HIRSCHBERG
I don’t speak Italian.
LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin’ mouth shut. In fact, why don’t you
start practicing right now.
BRIDGET
(meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?
UTIVICH
Do you mean me?
BRIDGET
I didn’t mean any offense.
UTIVICH
None taken, you German cunt.
LT. ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.
UTIVICH
I can’t drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:
BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!
UTIVICH
Gimmie a break. I’m from Manhattan.
LT. ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours
before the movie tomorrow.
More than enough time for you to learn to
drive.
UTIVICH
No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it’s not!
LT. ALDO
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And
yes, yes, yes, you will.
(changes tone)
Look, Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain’t copyin’ off of my test.
Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a
Tennessee mountain road.
And I’m a shit-for-brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?
HIRSCHBERG
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Teach ’im.
BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I’m a movie star. This
is a movie premiere.
I can’t show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But
sometime tomorrow I
have to get my hair done.
All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.
LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who
went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.
BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FIVE
“REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE”
FADE OFF
INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL’S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT
We’re in Shosanna and Marcel’s living quarters above the
cinema. We’ve never been in here before.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:
“NIGHT OF ‘NATION’S PRIDE’ PREMIERE”
Shosanna’s standing before a full-length mirror in a real
attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She’s stunning.
This is the first time in her life she’s had the opportunity
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard
coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the
Germanic miasma below.
SHOSANNA’S POV
WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests
dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up
the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally)
leading into Shosanna’s cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing
away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the
fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS
providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the
lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very
fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the periodstyle
black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it’s
on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.
From this point on, there’s no turning back. It’s all the way baby,
all the fucking way!
INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes
through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She
takes out a key and opens it.
INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT
Marcel’s prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for
reel five (which should never see the light of a projector)
lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection
booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.
SHOSANNA
Shut up, fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips
meet.
SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let’s go over it again?
MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.
SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film comes on
in the fourth reel, so somewhere
toward the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!
INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the
swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi
military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German
celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne
from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with
theater stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all
their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress
uniform.
CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from
a looking-down perspective of the guests entering the building.
THEN . . .
A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa’s
think bubble a little scene plays out.
THINK BUBBLE
A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and
screams at everybody:
COL. LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.
COL. LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It’s none
other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.
COL. LANDA
Can you speak, Sergeant?
SGT. WILLI
(weakly)
Yes, Colonel.
COL. LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in there.
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and
as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed
lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their
tuxedos flank her.
CU COL. LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Fräulein von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?
BRIDGET
Col. Landa, it’s been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
COL. LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere, Fräulein.
They chuckle and air kiss.
COL. LANDA
So what’s happened to your lovely
leg? A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.
BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests to fall into that honeypot.
Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .
COL. LANDA
Seriously, what happened?
BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.
COL. LANDA
Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured your
leg—mountain climbing?
BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes, it is.
A brief moment passes between the two . . .
THEN . . .
The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in
fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .
COL. LANDA
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don’t mean to laugh at
your misfortune. It’s just
. . . mountain climbing? I’m curious, Fräulein,
what could have ever
compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy
endeavor?
The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.
BRIDGET
Well, I shan’t be doing it again, I can tell
you that.
COL. LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this
mountain, last night?
BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday
morning.
COL. LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a second.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.
COL. LANDA
I’m just teasing you, Fräulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?
BRIDGET
I’m afraid neither of the three speak a word of
German. They’re friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(meaning Donny)
And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
The German Fräulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing
Basterds.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel
Hans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
but they can’t show it.
Aldo sticks out his hand . . .
LT. ALDO
Buongiorno.
The German takes his hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Margheriti . . .
(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?
LT. ALDO
(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .
. ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
I’m sorry, again . . . ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Once more . . .?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
Margheriti.
(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
What’s your name again?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Again . . . ?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg . . .
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the
group:
HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Dominick Decocco?
HIRSCHBERG
Dominic Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Bravo . . . Bravo.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find their seats.
Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Not so fast. Let’s enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us. I have some friends I’d
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
Merci.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle
Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she
is our hostess for the evening.
(FRENCH)
And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and
none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is
Bridget von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
BRIDGET
(FRENCH)
I’m afraid my companions don’t speak
any French. They’re Italian. This is Antonio,
Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
Actually, Fräulein von Hammersmark’s Italian
associates need help finding their seats.
Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind
as to escort them?
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black
uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .
Hirschberg . . .
reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .
He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because
if he’s successful tonight he’s going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says:
HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.
The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian
boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of
Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight,
she’s going to burn him alive, and says:
SHOSANNA
Prego.
BACK TO THE LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
YELLS IN GERMAN:
GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seats!
Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
I must call the Führer. He doesn’t
want to make his entrance until everybody is
seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The
Führer has
heard you’re here, and he wishes to commend you
personally.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Me? Why?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with
your resolve. An accident like you’ve just
experienced, and
yet you still show up to an
important party event. The Führer
was quite adamant in his gratitude. We’ll use
Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office.
(to Aldo
in Italian)
I’m afraid I must rob you of your companion,
but only for a moment.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently the Führer wishes to commend
me.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain
her long.
What are either of them supposed to do, argue?
Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers
in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he’s saying, leave the boy
alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?
Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna’s office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
auditorium, till it’s only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers
in the now-vacant lobby.
INT—SHOSANNA’S OFFICE—NIGHT
Shosanna’s cinema manager’s office. It’s small, cluttered, and
dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.
COL. LANDA
Have a seat, Fräulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and
places it in front of the fräulein.
He sits, their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?
Patting his lap.
COL. LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.
BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.
COL. LANDA
I assure you, Fräulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fräulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot
and places it in the colonel’s lap.
The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that
hold the fräulein’s shoe on her foot . . .
. . . . He removes the shoe . . .
. . . . Leaving only the fräulein’s bare foot . . .
THEN . . .
He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe
the fräulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .
He slips it on her foot . . .
. . . . It fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.
Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
What’s that American expression . . .
“If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it.”
He removes her foot from his lap.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
What now, Colonel?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Do you admit your treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
The only think I will admit to is resisting you
. . .
(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches . . .
(GERMAN)
. . . to my last breath.
COL. LANDA
“Resist to your last breath”?
SUDDENLY . . .
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
von Hammersmark’s lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the
violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridget’s face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat.
Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT
OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on
the elegant lady’s neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF
HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
She’s dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are
TREMBLING . . .
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling
that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK
(filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.
Into the phone, in German, he says:
COL. LANDA
Inform the Führer the audience has
taken their seats, and we’re ready
to begin.
Step one in Hans’s master plan, done.
He then dials another number . . .
INT—LOBBY—NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . . He’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .
He’s THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modernday
Secret Service, within seconds his wrists are handcuffed behind
his back and he’s searched. They find the BOMB attached to his
ankle. It’s removed, and a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his head.
Then he’s hoisted up and RUSHED out of the building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the
auditorium is none the wiser . . .
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the
master race, waiting for showtime.
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red
carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.
Aldo’s put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he’s SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany, Germans, German food, German
shepherd . . . anything.
COL. LANDA’S VOICE (OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner,
says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo
Raine, I presume?
LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?
COL. LANDA
You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you’re now in the hands of the S.S. My
hands to be exact. And they’ve been waiting a
long time to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo’s
face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo’s head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.
COL. LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur’s uniform,
bound and bagged like the lieutenant.
The truck drives off.
Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler’s motorcade
pull up to the cinema. Then the Führer, Goebbels, Francesca, and
the rest of the entourage make their way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.
EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.
INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the
truck.
Utivich is crying inside his hood.
LT. ALDO
Utivich?
UTIVICH
Is that you, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yep.
UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
LT. ALDO
No, I do not.
UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.
LT. ALDO
Nothin’ to be sorry about, son.
This bag get to anyone.
UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?
LT. ALDO
John Wayne’s a pampered movie star.
He bursts into tears if his cook
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin’ a bag over his head and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich giggles through the tears.
LT. ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin’
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich’s foot, and places his foot
on top.
The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.
EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La
Louisaiane).
The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.
INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open
for something else rustic tavern.
The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now
see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way
radio set up in the tavern.
Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated
American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.
COL. LANDA
Italian? Really?
(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been thinking?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak a little Italian—
COL. LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn’t begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don’t get me
wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what
with you losing your Germans. And I have
nothing but admiration for improvisation.
Still . . . Chico Marx is more
convincing. If the three of you had
shown up at the premiere dressed
in woman’s attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landa’s eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert outside.
They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the
private, and a German radio man in the corner.
COL. LANDA
So you’re Aldo the Apache?
LT. ALDO
So you’re the Jew Hunter?
COL. LANDA
Jew Hunter (pfuit). I’m a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally
I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.
UTIVICH
Well, you do hafta admit, it is
catchy.
COL. LANDA
Do you control the nicknames your enemies
bestow on you? Aldo the
Apache and the Little Man?
UTIVICH
What do you mean, the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
The German’s nickname for you.
UTIVICH
The German’s nickname for me is the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
Or the “Little One”, either one means you.
And as if to make my point, I’m a
little surprised how tall you
are in real life. I mean, you’re a
little fellow. But not circus-midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.
LT. ALDO
Where are my men? Where is Bridget
von Hammersmark?
COL. LANDA
Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I’m sure she’s in
whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Well, let’s just say she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paisanos
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—
LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?
COL. LANDA
Lt. Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t
interrogate every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors . . . ?
We simply aren’t operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg
and Donowitz should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.
And your mission, some
would call it a terrorist plot, as of
this moment is still a go.
The two basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.
LT. ALDO
That’s a pretty exciting story.
What’s next, Eliza on the ice?
COL. LANDA
However, all I have to do is
pick up that phone right there,
inform the cinema, and your plans
kaput.
LT. ALDO
IF they’re still there, and IF they’re still
alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no
way you gonna take
them boys without settin’ off them bombs.
COL. LANDA
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die, and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you’ve done to his big night. But you
won’t get Hitler, you won’t
get Goebbels, you won’t get Goering,
and you won’t get Boormann. And you
need all four to end the war.
(pause)
But if I don’t pick up that phone
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war . . . tonight.
The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills
three glasses. As he pours, he says:
COL. LANDA
So, gentlemen, let’s discuss the prospect of
ending the war . . . tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.
COL. LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitler’s death, or
possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .
. It’s as if I’m causing his death, even more
than yourselves.
Would you agree?
LT. ALDO
I guess so.
COL. LANDA
How about you, Utivich?
UTIVICH
I guess so too.
COL. LANDA
Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I
have no intention of killing Hitler, and
killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and
killing Boormann, not to mention winning the
war single-handedly for the Allies,
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.
Now they get it.
COL. LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
we have to make a deal.
LT. ALDO
What kinda deal?
COL. LANDA
The kind you wouldn’t have the
authority to make. However, I’m sure this
mission of yours has a
commanding officer? A general, I’m betting. For
. . .
(thinking)
. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.
COL. LANDA
Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, that’s a bingo?
LT. ALDO
You just say, bingo.
COL. LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a
very capable two-way
radio. And sitting behind it is a
more than capable radio operator
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the power of
the pen to authorize my—
let’s call it, the terms of my conditional
surrender, if that tastes better going down.
BACK TO THE PREMIER
Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH. She flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna throws the lever on the first projector.
The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM . . .
FILM REELS rotate . . .
35mm FILM moves through the projector’s film gate . . .
The opening seal of a film by the THIRD REICH flickers on the
SCREEN . . .
Goebbels and Francesca watch . . .
Hitler watches . . .
Fredrick watches . . .
Donowitz and Hirschberg watch . . .
Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window . . .
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna to the clearly marked film
can, REEL 4. The SURPRISE REEL.
BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the
other end.
COL. LANDA
. . . So, when the military history of this
night is written, it will be recorded that I
was part of
Operation Kino from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I’ve done in my guise as an S.S.
colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a
necessary evil to
establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine’s dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels’s opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last
part is actually true.
FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
I want my full military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.
He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided
conversation.
COL. LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of “Operation
Kino” to receive the Congressional Medal of
Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that
goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to purchase
property for me on
Nantucket island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I’ve saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist Party to a
swifter than imagined end. Do you
have all that, sir?
(pause)
I look forward to seeing you face to face as
well, sir.
(pause)
He’s right here.
The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his
orders:
RADIO VOICE (OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck and bring
them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir.
The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.
COL. LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschberg’s success.
You too, Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson
Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.
COL. LANDA
Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.
CHEERS.
BACK TO THE PREMIERE
WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in
a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.
A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers
the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
What’s the death toll?
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.
WE HEAR A SHOT.
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
48. General, I implore you, we must destroy
that tower!
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand
years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.
SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes “REEL 4” (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares
it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing
now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to be
show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much
to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
die wet one on her.
DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM
NAZIS. They’ve developed a dopey way of communicating with each
other in this hostile environment.
Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian
they say English words, only adding an “I” or “A” or “O”
to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian
accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:
They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ITALIAN-ISH)
I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.)
When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb.)
Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can’t set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazis.
Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his
ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of
the auditorium in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn’t get it.
HIRSCHBER
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
patience.
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a.
(They’re looking at the screen, not you.)
HIRSCHBERG
Fantastic-o.
(Fantastic.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o
(pointing to
watch)
You-a, pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and
get out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
What-o?
(What?)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought “What-a” meant “What.”
Does “What-o” mean “What,” as well?)
HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a “What-a.”
(Oh, sorry, I meant what.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a,
five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and
get the fuck out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Good-a, luck-a.
(Good luck.)
Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark
auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the
Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.
DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers’
gossip. They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through
them.
They look up but don’t disturb their time-off vibe.
Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole washroom to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.
MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into
the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors
and peers inside.
WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL’S POV
in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick’s exploits onscreen.
Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.
INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either
side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one
notices Marcel’s actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE
(backward) of Fredrick’s sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE
SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies
like a junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and
pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a
cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?
He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!
FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel’s
ear we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least
sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:
GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we’ll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth
door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly,
stares at him.
He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.
She doesn’t even smile. She says, all serious business:
SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?
FREDRICK
I came to visit you.
SHOSANNA
Can’t you see how busy I am?
FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend an assist.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, it’s not funny. You can’t
be here. This is your premiere. You
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.
FREDRICK
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains, this film
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men. Consequently,
the part of the film
that’s playing now, . . . I don’t like watching
this part.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but—
FREDRICK
—So, I thought I’d come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven’t lost my touch.
DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes
from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.
CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny’s feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi
enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY
ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN
. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE’RE EYE
LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who’s
done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE
THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF
THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge.
As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
(GERMAN)
Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now
pay up.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring
the way.
SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel change.
FREDRICK
Let me do it?
SHOSANNA
No.
FREDRICK
Oh, please, it’s been two years since I’ve done
a reel change.
SHOSANNA
I said, no.
FREDRICK
(cute whine)
Come on, it’s my premiere.
SHOSANNA
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass,
you’ve forgotten what the
word “no” means? No, Fredrick, you
can’t come in here. Now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat than we’ve seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.
FREDRICK
Well, it’s nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it’s just physical pain.
Fredrick steps forward . . .
Shosanna steps backward . . .
FREDRICK
I’m not a man you say “Go away”
to. There’s over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia that, if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me
at your peril.
BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.
SOLDIER’S POV
He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge
from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt
and black tuxedo vest, he’s quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny
walks toward us . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him get closer . . .
SOLDIER POV
Donny gets closer . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him closer still . . .
SOLDIER POV
Donny gets closer . . .

SOLDIER POV
Donny getting closer, begins to notice the German soldier notice
him . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His
face SCREAMS:
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!!!
The soldier’s GUN is out of its holster and rising toward
Donny’s chest . . .
WHEN . . .
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES
a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising
his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .
The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are
empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened
in front of them.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the
door.
FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick’s back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .
. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to
the floor . . .
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into
the audience . . .
The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her
weapon didn’t stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience . . .
. . . up to the big screen . . .
. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.
The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl’s
heart . . .
. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .
. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .
. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still
ALIVE . . .
Shosanna moves to him . . .
. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .
. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .
. . . He’s holding a LUGER in his hand . . .
. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .
BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
knees to the floor . . .
. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .
. . . FIRES . . .
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .
. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .
Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet
at a time . . .
. . . FIRES . . .
A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .
The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth
floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and
DYING . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring,
informing the projectionist it’s time for the REEL CHANGE.
Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s going
to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel
change.
CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German:
HITLER
Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary.
This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats
his hand.
PROJECTION BOOTH
Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great and painful
effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR . . .
AUDITORIUM
Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle,
then stands up and begins scooting past everybody in his row’s
knees.
PROJECTION BOOTH
Like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl’s mountain films,
Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was
Pitz Palu . . .
FILM ONSCREEN
Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top farright
corner of the FRAME, WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

Shosanna hanging onto the projector, waiting for the 2nd reel

BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel, smoking, waiting for his cue . . .
HIRSCHBERG

of the cinema toward the exit.

AUDITORIUM
ON THE SILVER SCREEN FREDRICK’S EX CU
CUT TO
ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU
CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (B/W sky),
SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so onscreen Shosanna is looking
down on the Nazis, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE stares
down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells “1984”
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.
HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When
he sees Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s gobsmacked.
BEHIND SCREEN
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the
EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says
in FRENCH:
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I’m interrupting
your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you
dispicable German swine that you’re all going
to die.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
react.
HIRSCHBERG
reacts.
MARCEL
smiles.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
And I want you to look deep in the face of the
Jew who’s going to do it.
AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE
While the shocked German audience is transfixed to the screen,
behind the heads of most of them . . .
The BOMB Landa set in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box . . .
EXPLODES.
BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS HITLER, FRANCESA, and BOORMANN, and
propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theater seat, across the
auditorium, into the opposite wall and taking out a portion
of the ceiling as well.
The crowd reacts . . .
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple
from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the
audience below . . .
ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the
face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!
BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of
nitrate film.
ONSCREEN SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling
little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE
OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA’S FACE
and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .
HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive “Day of the Locust”
SWARM OF BODIES . . .
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
their grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .
Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.
HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar
to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have
on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms,
heads, torsos, and asses.
THEN . . . ,
DONOWITZ’S TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.
COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE
THEATER.
As MADAME MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS . . .
These SUBTITLES APPEAR ONSCREEN as if on a military
teletype:
“OPERATION KINO A COMPLETE SUCCESS.”
FADE OUT
FADE UP
“HITLER DEAD. GOEBBELS DEAD. BOORMANN DEAD.
GOERING DEAD. ZOLLER DEAD. MOST OF HIGH COMMAND
DEAD.”
FADE OUT
FADE IN
“FOUR DAYS LATER, GERMANY SURRENDERS.”
FADE OUT
FADE IN
“ONCE UPON A TIME IN NAZI . . .
OCCUPIED FRANCE.”
CUT TO
EXT—WOODS—MORNING
It’s a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German
truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and
Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:
HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members
of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich,
both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.
Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.
Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
the two prisoners.
He does.
COL. LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.
DAGGER.
COL. LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your
prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the
colonel’s hands behind his back.
COL. LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Utivich cuffs the Colonel’s hands behind his back, Aldo
says:
LT. ALDO
I’m a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col. Landa is appalled.
COL. LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal
with your general for that man’s life!
LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t give
a fuck about him, they
need you.
COL. LANDA
You’ll be shot for this.
LT. ALDO
Naw, I don’t think so, more like I’ll
be chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You
know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you
made with the brass. End the war tonight? I’d
make that deal. How ’bout you, Utivich, you
make that deal?
UTIVICH
I’d make that deal.
LT. ALDO
I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
you’re willing to barbecue the whole high
command, I suppose that’s worth certain
considerations. Now I don’t
care about you gettin’ pensions,
merit badges, ticker-tape parades,
who gives a damn, let’s all go home.
But I do have one question.
When you go to your little place on
Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna
take off that handsome-looking S.S.
uniform of yours, ain’t ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn’t respond.
LT. ALDO
That’s what I thought. Now that . . .
. . . I can’t abide. How bout you,
Utivich, can you abide it?
UTIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.
LT. ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you’d wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
our pecker-suckin’ life. But I’m
aware that ain’t practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.
He opens Landa’s S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans’s
face.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give you a little
somethin you can’t take off.
CU COL. LANDA
The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
forehead.
COL. LANDA’S POV
On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
straddles him. And Utivich, who’s next to him. The two
Basterds admire Aldo’s handiwork.
Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:
LT. ALDO
You know somethin’, Utivich? I think this just
might be my masterpiece.
They ghoulishly giggle.

1 INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING 1
Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
and the big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and
are enjoying coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a
small address book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved
story about Madonna.
MR. PINK
"Like a Virgin" is all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.
The whole song is a metaphor for
big dicks.
MR. BLUE
No it's not. It's about a girl who
is very vulnerable and she's been
fucked over a few times. Then she
meets some guy who's really
sensitive--
MR. PINK
--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.
JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
Toby...Toby...think...think...
think...
MR. PINK
It's not about a nice girl who
meets a sensitive boy. Now granted
that's what "True Blue" is about,
no argument about that.
MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"
NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?"
That was a big ass hit for Madonna.
Shit, I don't even follow this Tops
In Pops shit, and I've at least
heard of "True Blue."
MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't
heard of it. All I asked was how
does it go? Excuse me for not
being the world's biggest Madonna
fan.
MR. BROWN
I hate Madonna.
MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff. You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I
tuned out.
MR. PINK
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a
point here. You're gonna make me
lose my train of thought.
JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.
MR. WHITE
What's that?
JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
age. Toby what? What the fuck was
her last name?
MR. PINK
Where was I?
MR. ORANGE
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella. But "Like a Virgin" was a
metaphor for big dicks.
MR. PINK
Let me tell ya what "Like a
Virgin"'s about. It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?
2.
MR. WHITE
A lot.
MR. PINK
Then one day she meets a John
Holmes motherfucker, and it's like,
whoa baby. This mother fucker's
like Charles Bronson in "The Great
Escape." He's diggin tunnels. Now
she's gettin this serious dick
action, she's feelin something she
ain't felt since forever. Pain.
JOE
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
MR. PINK
It hurts. It hurts her. It
shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now. But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts. It
hurts like the first time. The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like a Virgin."
The fellas crack up.
JOE
Wong?
MR. PINK
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What
the fuck do you know about it
anyway? You're still listening to
Jerry-fucking-Vale.
JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You
know, like the Chinese name?
Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.
MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.
JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin? Give me my book back!
MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
I'll give it back when we leave.
3.
JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
we leave, give it back now.
MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names. "Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby
Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan." I
got Madonna's big dick outta my
right ear, and Toby Jap I-don'tknow-
what, outta my left.
JOE
What do you care?
MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I
care a lot.
JOE
Give me my book.
MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?
JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.
MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.
MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?
MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to KBILLY's
super sounds of the
seventies weekend?
MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?
NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they been
playin?
4.
MR. PINK
No, I can't. You know what I heard
the other day? "Heartbeat - It's
Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco
and the DeFranco Family. I haven't
heard that since I was in fifth
fuckin grade.
NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin it. And "The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
on. Now I ain't heard that song
since it was big, but when it was
big, I heard it a million- trillion
times. I'm listening to it this
morning, and this was the first
time I ever realized that the lady
singing the song, was the one who
killed Andy.
MR. BLUE
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
killed the guy?
NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot
Andy.
MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.
NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it. I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on
before. I thought when she said
that little sister stuff, she was
talkin about her sister- in-law,
the cheatin wife.
JOE
No, she did it. She killed the
cheatin wife, too.
MR. PINK
You know the part in "Gypsies,
Tramps and Theives," when she says
"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
what he'd done?" I could never
figure out what he did.
The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She
has the check, and a pot of coffee.
5.
WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more coffee.
JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin it. I'll
take care of the check.
She hands the bill to him.
WAITRESS
Here ya go. Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.
JOE
Sure thing.
WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.
They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.
JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my
book back.
MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.
JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?
Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr White acts
shot. Joe exits.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.
Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.
NICE GUY EDDIE (CONT’D)
C'mon, throw in a buck.
MR. WHITE
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
6.
MR. WHITE
I don't believe in it.
NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?
MR. PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid, he's a madman,
this guy.
MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make? They make shit.
MR. WHITE
Don't give me that. She don't make
enough money, she can quit.
Everybody laughs.
NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that. So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?
MR. WHITE
I don't tip because society says I
gotta. I tip when somebody
deserves a tip. When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds. As far
as I'm concerned, they're just doin
their job.
MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.
MR. WHITE
Our girl was okay. She didn't do
anything special.
MR. BLONDE
What's something special, take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick?
They all laugh.
NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for
that.
7.
MR. WRITE
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've
been here a long fuckin time, and
she's only filled my cup three
times. When I order coffee, I
want it filled six times.
MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?
MR. WHITE
The words "too busy" shouldn't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.
They all laugh.
MR. WHITE
These ladies aren't starvin to
death. They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--
MR. ORANGE
--It is that too--
NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too. But it's also he
couldn't get a waiter job. You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
"Fuck those cunts and their fucking
tips."
MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?
Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.
MR. WHITE
Do you know what this is? It's the
world's smallest violin, playing
just for the waitresses.
8.
MR. BLONDE
You don't have any idea what you're
talking about. These people bust
their ass. This is a hard job.
MR. WHITE
So's working at McDonald's, but you
don't feel the need to tip them.
They're servin ya food, you should
tip em. But no, society says tip
these guys over here, but not those
guys over there. That's bullshit.
MR. ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.
MR. WHITE
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.
MR. BROWN
These people are taxed on the tips
they make. When you stiff 'em, you
cost them money.
MR. BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country. It's
the one jab basically any woman can
get, and make a living on. The
reason is because of tips.
MR. WHITE
Fuck all that.
They all laugh.
MR. WHITE (CONT’D)
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips. That's
fucked up. But that ain't my
fault. it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the many
groups the government fucks in the
ass on a regular basis. You show me
a paper says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.
Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.
9.
And this non- college bullshit
you're telling me, I got two words
for that: "Learn to fuckin type."
Cause if you're expecting me to
help out with the rent, you're in
for a big fuckin surprise.
MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me. Give me my
dollar back.
Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.
JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to
rambling. Wait a minute, who
didn't throw in?
MR. ORANGE
Mr. White.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. White?
(to Mr. White)
Why?
MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. White)
You don't tip? Why?
MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. White)
You don't believe in it?
MR. ORANGE
Nope.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. White)
10.
Cough up the buck, ya cheap
bastard, I paid for your goddamn
breakfast.
MR. WHITE
Because you paid for the breakfast,
I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
JOE
Whatever. Just throw in your
dollar, and let's move.
(to Mr. Blonde)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants. I'm fuckin dealin with
infants.
The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in the
F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
carrying a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
talking amongst themselves.
2 EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY 2
CREDIT
SEQUENCE:
When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:
Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.
Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS,
through traffic.
Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:
SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.
Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:
SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry. I can't believe she
killed me. Who would've fuckin
thought that?
CUT TO:
11.
3 INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY 3
The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the
backseat. He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers both
him and the backseat.
Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of
the getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
out of traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he keeps
talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.
They are the only two in the car.
MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now! You're hurt. You're hurt
really fucking bad, but you ain't
dying.
MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me. I'm gonna die, I know
it.
MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine. Are you
a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer
me please, are you a doctor?
MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!
MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about. So if
you're through giving me your
amateur opinion, lie back and
listen to the news. I'm taking you
back to the rendezvous, Joe's gonna
get you a doctor, the doctor's
gonna fix you up, and you're gonna
be okay. Now say it: you're gonna
be okay. Say it: you're gonna be
okay!
Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on
the steering wheel.
MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're gonna
be okay!
12.
MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.
MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.
4 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 4
The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.
Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.
Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.
MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on,
and wait for Joe. I can't do
anything for you, but when Joe gets
here, which should be anytime now,
he'll be able to help you. We're
just gonna sit here, and wait for
Joe. Who are we waiting for?
MR. ORANGE
Joe.
MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.
MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!
Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.
MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right
here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you
please hold me.
Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.
13.
MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've been
brave enough for one day. I want
you to just relax now. You're not
gonna die, you're gonna be fine.
When Joe gets here, he'll make ya a
hundred percent again.
Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's
still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.
MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the
ointment, but if help doesn't come
soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't
give a fuck about jail, I just
don't wanna die.
MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?
MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt,
and I'm hurt bad.
MR. WHITE
It's not good...
MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what
you're trying to do. I was
panicking for a moment, but I've
got my senses back now. The
situation is, I'm shot in the
belly. And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.
MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.
MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit
about jail. But I can't die. You
don't have to take me in. Just
drive me up to the front, drop me
on the sidewalk. I'll take care of
myself. I won't tell them
anything. I swear to fucking god,
I won't tell 'em anything. Look in
my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
14.
I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll
be safe.
MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to--
MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die! I need a
doctor! I'm begging you, take me
to a doctor.
Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:
MR. ORANGE (CONT’D)
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.
Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps
inside.
MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?
Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.
Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.
MR. WHITE
Gun shot.
MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great!
Where's Brown?
MR. WHITE
Dead.
MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think? The
cops shot him.
MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr. Orange)
Is it bad?
15.
MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?
MR. PINK
This is so fucked up. Somebody
fucked us big time.
MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?
MR. PINK
You even doubt it? I don't think
we got set up, I know we got set
up! I mean really, seriously,
where did all those cops come from,
huh? One minute they're not there,
the next minute they're there. I
didn't hear any sirens. The alarm
went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm
goes off, you got an average of
four minutes response time. Unless
a patrol car is cruising that
street, at that particular moment,
you got four minutes before they
can realistically respond. In one
minute there were seventeen blue
boys out there. All loaded for
bear, all knowing exactly what the
fuck they were doing, and they were
all just there! Remember that
second wave that showed up in the
cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm. but those
other motherfuckers were already
there, they were waiting for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?
MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there. And after we got
away, I've just been dealin with
him.
MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking
about it. Cause I, sure as fuck,
am thinking about it. In fact,
that's all I'm thinking about. I
came this close to just driving
off. Whoever set us up, knows
about this place.
16.
There could've been cops sitting
here waiting for me. For all we
know, there's cops, driving fast,
on their way here now.
MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...
The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We move
past it, and see down a hall.
5 INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY 5
At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door is
partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is
obscured, but Mr. White is in view.
MR. PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here? I
felt funny about this job right
off. As soon as I felt it I should
said "No thank you", and walked.
But I never fucking listen. Every
time I ever got burned buying weed,
I always knew the guy wasn't right.
I just felt it. But I wanted to
believe him. If he's not lyin to
me, and it really is Thai stick,
then whoa baby. But it's never
Thai stick. and I always said if I
felt that way about a job, I'd
walk. And I did, and I didn't,
because of fuckin money!
MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you
cool. Are you cool?
MR. PINK
I'm cool.
MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.
We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.
MR. WHITE (CONT’D)
I'm gonna get me my smokes.
Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards us,
bent over the sink.
17.
Then he grabs a towels, and dries his face. Mr White ENTERS
FRAME with a pack of Chesterfields in his hand.
MR. WHITE (CONT’D)
Want a smoke?
MR. PINK
Why not?
The two men light up.
MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what
happened. We're in the place,
everything's going fine. Then the
alarm gets tripped. I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right, it was like, bam! I
blink my eyes are they're there.
Everybody starts going apeshit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
the--
MR. PINK
--That's not correct.
MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?
MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off. They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started
shooting everyone.
MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw
the cops.
MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
soon. They didn't let their
presence be known until after Mr.
Blonde went off. I'm not sayin
they weren't there, I'm sayin they
were there. But they didn't move
in till Mr. Blonde became a madman.
That's how I know we were set up.
You can see that, can't you, Mr.
White?
MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White"
shit--
18.
MR. PINK
--Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know! I sure as hell ain't
gonna tell ya mine.
MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?
MR. PINK
Shot my way out. Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.
CUT TO:
6 EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY 6
Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has a
canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.
FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with
them.
We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL is
plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's listening to
LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and skating
backwards to the beat of the song.
Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.
Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.
7 INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY 7
The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the car's
driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it
off, and points his magnum at the driver.
MR. PINK
Get outta the car! Get the fuck
outta the car!
The Shocked Woman starts screaming.
Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.
19.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
Open the fucking door!
EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.
8 EXT. STREET - DAY 8
DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.
Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.
The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.
Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at the
Cops.
Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.
Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.
Cops FIRE.
9 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 9
CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.
BACK TO:
10 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 10
Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.
MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you
kill anybody?
MR. WHITE
A few cops.
MR. PINK
No real people?
MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.
MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen.
20.
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that?
MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if
I gotta get out that door, and
you're standing in my way, one way
of the other, you're gettin outta
my way.
MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it. A
choice between doin ten years, and
takin out some stupid motherfucker,
ain't no choice at all. But I
ain't no madman either. What the
fuck was Joe thinkin? You can't
work with a guy like that. That
mother- fucker's unstable. What do
you think? Do you think he
panicked, or ya think he's just
trigger- happy?
MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us, when he shot up the place.
I came this fucking close--
(hold up two fingers and
makes a tiny space
between them)
--to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics. When things get
tense, everybody panics. Everybody.
I don't care what your name is, you
can't help it. It's human nature.
But ya panic on the inside.
Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds
of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation.
What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional. A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next. I
mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty,
maybe twenty-one?
21.
MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to anybody
else?
MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car
and Mr. Brown floored it. After
that, I don't know what went down.
MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde
or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
got the foggiest. Once I got out,
I never looked back.
MR. WHITE
What do you think?
MR. PINK
What do I think? I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.
MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through? You found a hole.
MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking
miracle. But if they did get away,
where the fuck are they?
MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--
MR. PINK
Nope.
MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?
MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.
MR. WHITE
Where?
MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?
MR. WHITE
Where? Are they out in the car?
22.
MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car. No, I
don't have them on me. Ya wanna go
with me and get 'em? Yes, we can
go right now. But first listen to
what I'm telling you. We were
fuckin set up! Somebody is in
league with the cops. We got a
Judas in our midst. And I'm
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here.
MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.
MR. PINK
Then where is everybody? I say the
plan became null and void once we
found out we got a rat in the
house. We ain't got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could
both be dead
or arrested. They could be sweatin 'em, down at the station
house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they
can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening
right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars,
drivin here this minute.
MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.
MR. PINK
What?
MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.
MR. PINK
No shit?
MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time.
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing. Just walked away from it.
MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time? Mr.
Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe?
23.
It's Joe's show, he set this whole
thing up. Maybe he set it up to
set it up.
MR. WHITE
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back
a long time. I can tell ya
straight up, Joe definitely didn't
have anything to do with this
bullshit.
MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long
time. I known Joe since I was a
kid. But me saying Joe definitely
couldn't have done it is
ridiculous. I can say I definitely
didn't do it, cause I know what I
did or didn't do. But I can't
definitely say that about anybody
else, 'cause I don't definitely
know. For all I know, you're the
rat.
MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.
MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For all
we know, he's the rat.
Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange. Mr. White's
expression changes.
MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!
11 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 11
They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious. The CAMERA
hovers over the action. Mr. Pink reaches him first.
MR. PINK
Is he dead?
Mr. White pushes him out of the way. He feels the pulse on
Mr. Orange's neck.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
So, is he dead or what?
MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.
24.
MR. PINK
So what is it?
MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.
MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin shit outta me.
I thought he was dead fer sure.
Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.
MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we
don't get him to a hospital.
MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.
MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this man
won't live through the night. That
bullet in his belly is my fault.
Now while that might not mean jack
shit to you, it means a helluva lot
to me. And I'm not gonna just sit
around and watch him die.
MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy. We gotta book up.
MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel? We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds
like a stuck pig, and when he's
awake, he screams in pain.
MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.
MR. WHITE
Joe could help him. If we can get
in touch with Joe, Joe could get
him to a doctor, Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him.
During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a C.U. of Mr.
White.
MR. PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him?
25.
He's supposed to be here, but he
ain't, which is making me nervous
about being here. Even if Joe is
on the up and up, he's probably not
gonna be that happy with us. Joe
planned a robbery, but he's got a
blood bath on his hands now. Dead
cops, dead robbers, dead
civilians...Jesus Christ! I tend
to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight. If I was
him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible.
MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was
askin me to take him to a hospital.
Now I don't like turning him over
to the cops, but if we don't, he's
dead. He begged me to do it. I
told him to hold off till Joe got
here.
MR. PINK (OS)
Well Joe ain't gettin here. We're
on our own. Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so
if you know somebody, call 'em.
MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.
MR. PINK (OS)
Well, I guess we drop him off at
the hospital. Since he don't know
nothin about us, I say it's his
decision.
MR. WHITE'S
POV:
C.U. OF MR. PINK.
MR. WHITE (OS)
Well, he knows a little about me.
MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?
MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him my first name, and where
I'm from.
26.
There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then
he SCREAMS:
MR. PINK
Why!
MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago. It was just a casual
conversation.
MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?
MR. WHITE (OS)
He asked.
Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.
MR. WHITE (OS) (CONT’D)
We had just gotten away from the
cops. He just got shot. It was my
fuckin fault he got shot. He's a
fuckin bloody mess - he's
screaming. I swear to god, I
thought we was gonna die right then
and there. I'm tryin to comfort
him, telling him not to worry, he's
gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care
of him. And he asked me what my
name was. I mean, the man was dyin
in my arms. What the fuck was I
supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I
can't give out that information,
it's against the rules. I don't
trust you enough."? Maybe I
shoulda, but I couldn't.
MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful--
MR. WHITE (OS)
Don't fuckin patronize me.
MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?
MR. WHITE (OS)
Of course.
27.
MR. PINK
Well that's that, then. I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already. But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is, (i) where
you're from and (d) what your
specialty is. They ain't gonna
hafta show him a helluva lot of
pictures for him to pick you out.
That's it right, you didn't tell
him anything else that could narrow
down the selection?
MR. WHITE (OS)
If I have to tell you again to back
off, me an you are gonna go round
and round.
Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.
MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
MR. WHITE (OS)
If we don't, he'll die.
MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that. But
some fellas are lucky, and some
ain't.
MR. WHITE (OS)
That fuckin did it!
Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in the
mouth.
END OF POV
Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic
fight. They go at each other like a couple of alley cats.
As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:
MR. WHITE
You little motherfucker!
Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:
28.
MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?! You wanna
fuck with me?! I'll show you who
you're fuckin with!
The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.
Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.
Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out.
Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, and
goes for his own weapon.
The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.
MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little
piece of shit? Take a shot!
MR. PINK
Fuck you, White! I didn't create
this situation, I'm just dealin
with it. You're acting like a
first-year fuckin thief. I'm actin
like a professional. They get him,
they can get you, they get you,
they get closer to me, and that
can't happen. And you, you
motherfucker, are looking at me
like it's my fault. I didn't tell
him my name. I didn't tell him
where I was from. I didn't tell
him what I knew better than to tell
him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago,
you almost told me your name. You,
buddy, are stuck in a situation you
created. So if you wanna throw bad
looks somewhere, throw 'em at a
mirror.
Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
So if you wanna shoot somebody, put
that gun in your mouth and shoot
yourself.
Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:
29.
VOICE (OS)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.
12 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE 12
The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.
Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and
eating a hot dog.
MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought
you might've gotten caught. What
happened?
Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and
starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out.
He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he just
eats his hot dog and sips his coke.
This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr. Pink
tries to talk through it.
We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
Really, how did you get away?
Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
You saw what happened to me, I
found a hole and booked.
Silence.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
Where's Mr. Blue?
Blonde looks in the bathroom.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
We were hopin you two would be
together.
Blonde looks out the window.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr. Blue and you?
Blonde walks away from the window.
30.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
We were worried the cops got ya.
Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
He got it in the belly. He's still
alive, but won't be for long.
MR. WHITE
Enough! You better start talkin to
us, asshole, cause we got shit we
need to talk about. We're already
freaked out, we need you actin
freaky like we need a fuckin bag on
our hip.
Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.
MR. BLONDE
So, talk.
MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the house.
MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the
house.
MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think
that?
MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?
MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.
MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure
anymore. We're leaving, and you
should go with us.
MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.
Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.
After a few beats the silence is broken.
31.
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta
here.
Mr. White turns to leave.
MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr. White.
Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr.
Blonde.
MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac! It's your fuckin
fault we're in so much trouble.
Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.
MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr. White)
What's this guy's problem?
MR. WHITE
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta
problem. I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who almost
gets me shot!
MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin about?
MR. WHITE
That fuckin shooting spree in the
store.
MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.
MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole! If
I had any idea what type of guy you
were, I never would've agreed to
work with you.
MR. BLONDE
You gonna back all day, little
doggie, or are you gonna bite?
MR. WHITE
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't
catch it. Would you repeat it?
32.
MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all
day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?
MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm
the only one actin like a
professional. You guys act like a
bunch of fuckin niggers. You ever
work a job with a bunch of niggers?
They're just like you two, always
fightin, always sayin they're gonna
kill one another.
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you thought
about takin him out.
MR. PINK
Then. That time has passed. Right
now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I
completely trust. He's too fuckin
homicidal to be workin with the
cops.
MR. WHITE
You takin his side?
MR. PINK
Fuck sides! What we need is a
little solidarity here. Somebody's
stickin a red hot poker up our
asses and we gotta find out whose
hand's on the handle. Now I know
I'm no piece of shit...
(referring to Mr. White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr. Blonde)
33.
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level. So let's figure out
who's the bad guy.
Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.
Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.
MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't
you? Me too. I don't know about
the rest of you fellas, but my
heart's
beatin fast. (pause for a beat) Okay you guys, follow me.
Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.
The other two men just follow him with their eyes.
MR. WHITE
Follow you where?
MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.
MR. WHITE
Why?
MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.
Mr. Blonde walks out.
13 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 13
Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind. The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.
MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.
MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.
MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?
34.
MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.
MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?
MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him. He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.
MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
the fuck didn't you say that in the
first place?
MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.
MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
MR. BLONDE
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.
Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car. A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.
MR. BLONDE (CONT’D)
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.
INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".
14 INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY 14
We're inside the office of Joe Cabot. Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.
JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
about it. You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
embarrassing me. I don't need to
be told what I already know.
35.
When you have bad months, you do
what every business man in the
worlds does, I don't care if he's
Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
Ya ride it out.
There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.
JOE (CONT’D)
Come in.
One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
inside. Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
towards the man.
TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.
JOE
Tell him to come in.
Teddy leaves.
JOE (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here. I
gotta go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.
He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the front
of the desk.
Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.
Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
Blonde. Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
style jacket.
Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.
The two men embrace each other. Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.
JOE (CONT’D)
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
good, ain't it?
VIC
It's a change.
36.
JOE
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy
Martin?
VIC
Sure.
JOE
Take a seat.
Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet. Vic sits in a chair
set in front of Joe's desk.
JOE (CONT’D)
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?
VIC
A guy named Koons. Craig Koons.
JOE
How is he?
VIC
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.
JOE
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for twentyfive
cents. Fuckin nigger gets
Doris Day as a parole officer. But
a good fella like you gets stuck
with a ball-bustin prick.
Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.
Vic swallows some Remy.
VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care
packages on the inside.
JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do? Just forget about you?
VIC
I just wanted you to know, they
meant a lot.
37.
JOE
It's the least I could do Vic. I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side grin
at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a
story? What're your plans?
VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back to
work. But I got this Koons prick
deep up my ass. He won't let me
leave the halfway house till I get
some piece of shit job. My plans
have always been to be part of the
team again.
There's a KNOCK at the door.
JOE
Come in.
The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie. Vic
turns around in his seat and sees him.
EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.
Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
How ya doin, Toothpick?
VIC
Fine, now.
EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you
up personally at the pen. This
whole week's just been crazy. I've
had my head up my ass the entire
time.
VIC
Funny you should mention it. That's
what your father and I been talkin
about.
EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?
38.
VIC
No. That your head's been up your
ass. I walk through the door and
Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
god. Finally somebody who knows
what the fuck he's doing. Vic,
Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
up." And I say "Well, Joe, I
coulda told you that." "I'm
ruined! He's ruining me! My son,
I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin toilet!"
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin tales out of school.
You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im
yourself.
JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way. But when Vic
asked me how's business, well, you
don't lie to a man who's just done
four years in the slammer for ya.
Eddie bobs his head up and down.
EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?
Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.
The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle
on the floor of Joe's office.
Joe's on his feet yelling at them.
JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough!
Playtime's over! You wanna roll
around on the floor, do it in
Eddie's office, not mine!
The two men break it up. They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out. As they get themselves
together, they continue to taunt one another.
EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?
JOE
What?
39.
EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.
VIC
You fuckin wish.
EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my father's
office, you sick bastard. Look,
Vic, whatever you wanna do in the
privacy of your own home, go do it.
But don't try to fuck me. I don't
think of you that way. I mean, I
like you a lot--
VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
wouldn't throw you to the crew.
EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin punks in the ass
made you appreciate prime rib when
you get it.
VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but
I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd
be suckin the dick and going down
on a mangy T-bone hound.
EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin like a nigger. It's all
that black semen been shootin up
his butt. It's backed up into his
brain and comes out of his mouth.
JOE
Are you two finished? We were
talkin about some serious shit when
you came in Eddie. We got a big
problem we're tryin to solve. Now
Eddie, would you like to sit down
and help us solve it, or do you two
wanna piss fart around?
Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it. So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.
40.
JOE (CONT’D)
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
parole problem.
EDDIE
Really? Who's your P.O.?
VIC
Craig Koons.
EDDIE
Koons? Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.
VIC
He is a motherfucker. He won't let
me leave the halfway house till I
get some piece of shit job.
EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?
VIC
I wanna. But I gotta show this
asshole I got an honest-togoodness
job before he'll let me
move out on my own. I can't work
for you guys and be worried about
gettin back before ten o'clock
curfew.
JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?
EDDIE
This isn't all that bad. We can
give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
Put you on the rotation at Long
Beach as a dock worker.
VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.
EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit. You
don't really work there. But as
far as the records are concerned,
you do. I call up Matthews, the
foreman, tell him he's got a new
guy. You're on the schedule.
41.
You got a timecard, it's clocked in
and out for you everyday, and you
get a pay check at the end of the
week. And ya know dock workers
don't do too bad. So you can move
into a halfway decent place without
Koons thinkin "what the fuck." And
if Koons ever wants to make a
surprise visit, you're gone that
day. That day we sent you to
Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you
needed to unload there. You're at
the Taft airstrip pickin up a bunch
of shit and bringing it back. Part
of your jab is goin different
places - and we got places all over
the place.
JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.
EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you
to Matthews, tell him what's going
on.
VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me
for real work?
JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time
right now. Things are kinda--
EDDIE
--Nuts. We got a big meeting in
Vegas coming up. And we're kinda
just gettin ready for that right
now.
JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
Beach. Give ya some cash, get that
Koons fuck off your back, and we'll
be talking to ya.
42.
EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just
hear it out. I know you don't like
to use any of the boys on these
jobs, but technically, Vic ain't
one of the boys. He's been gone
for four years. He ain't on no
one's list. Ya know he can handle
himself, ya know you can trust him.
Joe looks at Vic.
Vic has no idea what they're talking about.
JOE
How would you feel about pullin a
heist with about five other guys?
VIC
What's the exposure like?
JOE
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough
two minutes. It's a hold up,
daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd. But you have
the fellas to deal with the crowd.
It's a jewelry store. They're
getting a big shipment of South
African diamonds on a certain day.
They're like a way station. It's
gonna get picked up the next day
and sent to Hamburg. When you walk
through the door, you'll know right
where to go for the rich stones.
The fellas are good, me and Nice Guy picked em. Nobody
knows anybody else. Nobody's connected. I don't use
connected guys for this shit.
VIC
What's the cut?
JOE
Juicy, man, real juicy.
Toothpick Vic smiles.
So does Nice Guy Eddie.

15 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY 15
Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone. The sounds of the seventies are coming
out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes Where My
Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.
EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that. I gotta talk
with daddy and find out what he
wants done.
FLASH ON
16 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 16
The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. "Love
Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.
17 BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE 17
EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me. He
said the place turned into a fuckin
bullet festival. He took a cop as
hostage, just to get the fuck out
of there.
FLASH ON
18 WAREHOUSE 18
The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.
19 BACK TO EDDIE 19
EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin? He's
fuckin driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that. I don't
know who has the loot, if anybody
has the loot. Who's dead, who's
alive, who's caught, who's not...
44.
I will know, I'm practically there. But what do I tell
these guys about daddy? (pause) You sure that's what he
said? (pause) Okay, that's what I'll tell em.
CUT TO:
20 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 20
Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.
Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse. He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.
EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.
Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open, and
steps inside the warehouse.
21 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 21
The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
WAILING on him.
Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.
EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin on?
Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.
MR. PINK MR. WHITE
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a You're askin what's goin cop.
on? Where the fuck is Joe?
Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.
EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
up!
MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.
MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were
waiting for us.
45.
EDDIE
What? Nobody set anybody up.
MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin for us!
EDDIE
Bullshit.
MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
there, we were. And I'm tellin ya,
the cops had that store staked out.
EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've
been askin each other?
EDDIE
And what are your answers? Was it
me? You think I set you up?
MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.
EDDIE
Nobody did. You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west
show, and you wonder why cops show
up.
MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?
EDDIE
I ain't talked to him. I talked to
Dov. Dov said he's comin out here,
and he's fucking pissed.
MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.
MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr. Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?
EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
chance to breathe. I got a few
questions of my own, ya know.
46.
MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.
EDDIE
I'll call somebody.
MR. WHITE
Who?
EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck
d'you think. I'll call a doctor,
take care of him, fix 'm right up.
No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.
EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Blue?
MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's
alive or the cops got him or they
don't.
DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.
EDDIE (OS)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the cop)
Why the hell are you beating on
him?
MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set
us up.
EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough,
he'll tell ya he started the
Chicago fire. That don't
necessarily make it so. Okay,
first things fucking last, where's
the shit? Please tell me somebody
brought something with them.
47.
MR. PINK
I got a bag. I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.
EDDIE
Well, let's go get it. We also
gotta get rid of all those cars. It
looks like Sam's hot car lot
outside.
(pointing to Mr. Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange
and the cop.
(referring to Mr. Pink
and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll
follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick
you up, then we'll pick up the
stones. And while I'm following
you, I'll arrange for some sort of
a doctor for our friend.
MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with him.
Meaning Mr. Blonde.
EDDIE
Why not?
Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.
MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking
psycho. And if you think Joe's
pissed at us, that ain't nothing
compared to how pissed off I am at
him, for puttin me in the same room
as this bastard.
MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin up with?
As soon as I walk through the door
I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm
what you told me about us stayin
put and Mr. White whips out his
gun, sticks it in my face, and
starts screaming "You motherfucker,
I'm gonna blow you away, blah,
blah, blah."
48.
MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin tell him.
MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he went
crazy in the store.
MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin.
Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
store.
MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it. I blew 'em full
of holes. If they hadn't done what
I told 'em not it, they'd still be
alive.
MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?
MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.
EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop? We ain't lettin him go.
Not after he's seen everybody. You
should've never took him outta your
trunk in the first place.
MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.
EDDIE
There is no fuckin set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news. Blondie,
you stay here and take care of them
two. White and Pink come with me,
'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all
those fucking cars parked out
front, he's going to be as mad at
me as he is at you.
49.
Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.
22 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP 22
Mr. Blonde closes the door after them. He then slowly turns
his head towards the cop.
MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.
C.U. COP'S FACE.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now where were we?
COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up. I've
only been on the force eight
months, nobody tells me anything! I
don't know anything! You can
torture me if you want--
MR. BLONDE (OS)
--Thanks, don't mind if I do.
COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
First off, I don't have a boss. Are
you clear about that?
He SLAPS the cop's face.
MR. BLONDE (OS) (CONT’D)
I asked you a question. Are you
clear about that?
COP
Yes.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know. I'm gonna
torture you for awhile regardless.
Not to get information, but because
torturing a cop amuses me. There's
nothing you can say, there's
nothing you can do. Except pray for
death.
50.
He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.
COP'S POV
Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.
MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
"super sounds of the seventies"
weekend.
He turns on the radio.
Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
over the speaker.
NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.
Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.
He opens a large knife.
He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits in
it.
Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding the
knife, singing along with the song.
Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.
A SLASH across the face.
The cop/camera moves around wildly.
Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.
Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.
The cop/camera moves around wildly.
Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.
Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out of
the way.
23 INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT 23
We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...
...to his car. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of
gasoline.
He walks back inside the warehouse...
51.
24 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 24
...carrying the can of gas.
Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
BEGGING him not to do this.
Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.
Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:
MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me, Jokers
to the right. Here I am, stuck in
the middle with you."
He moves the match up to the cop...
...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.
The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the bloody
Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.
We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET HITS
and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.
Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.
Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
trail behind him.
When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.
MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?
COP
Jeffrey.
MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey what?
COP
Jeffrey Andrews.
MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Jeffrey Andrews. I'm
a cop.
JEFFREY
I know.
52.
MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?
JEFFREY
Your name's Freddy something.
MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.
JEFFREY
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
once, about five months ago.
MR. ORANGE
Shit. I don't remember that at
all.
JEFFREY
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?
The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.
MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey starts to weep.
JEFFREY
That fucking bastard! That fucking
sick fucking bastard!
MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
There's officers positioned and
waiting to move in a block away.
JEFFREY
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting for?
That motherfucker cut off my ear!
He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying. They don't know
that. All they know is they're not
to make a move until Joe Cabot
shows up. I was sent undercover to
get Cabot. You heard 'em, they
said he's on his way.
53.
Don't pussy out on me now, Jeffrey.
We're just gonna sit here and bleed
until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin head through that door.

INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"
25 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT 25
A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star on
it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny bacon,
cheese and avocado burger. He sits in a booth all alone.
He's waiting for somebody. As he waits, he practically
empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his french fries, not
by mistake either--that's just how he likes it.
We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing a
high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot
Holdaway, and head his way. Holdaway sees Freddy bop
towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered across
his face.
CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's
inside. Cabot's doing a job and
take a big fat guess who he wants
on the team?
HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy
joke.
LOW ANGLE
looking up at Freddy, who's
standing at the table.
FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there. I'm
up his ass.
CU ON HOLDAWAY
Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles.
HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.
54.
26 EXT. DENNY'S - NIGHT 26
We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway. Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.
27 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT 27
FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY
We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
Freddy. We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
to meet me. He says I should just
hang around my apartment and wait
for a phone call. Well after
waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin phone, he calls me last
night and says Joe's ready, and
he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.
The freeze frame ENDS. Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed
and says:
HOLDAWAY
Woo all picked you up?
From here to end we cut back and forth.
FREDDY
Nice Guy. When we got to the
bar...
HOLDAWAY
...What bar?
FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
When we got there, I met Joe and a
guy named Mr. White. It's a phony
name. My name's Mr. Orange.
HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?
FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?
HOLDAWAY
Yeah.
55.
FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't
one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from outta town. But
Joe knows him real well.
HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?
FREDDY
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're buddies.
HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?
FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?
HOLDAWAY
Yeah.
FREDDY
A little.
HOLDAWAY
What about?
FREDDY
The Brewers.
HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?
FREDDY
Yeah. They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.
HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers
fan, his ass has gotta be from
Wisconsin. And I'll bet you
everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-I-know, that in
Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I
want you to go through the mugs of
guys from old Milwaukee with a
history of armed robbery, and put a
name to that face.
Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.
56.
HOLDAWAY (CONT’D)
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how I
knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
shit like that.
Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now. He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before. I read him my
credits. I robbed a few gas and
sips, sold some weed, told him
recently I held the shotgun while
me and another guy pulled down a
poker game in Portland.
CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.
HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?
FREDDY
Fuckin-A. I tell it real good,
too.
28 INT. MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 28
Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt. Freddy
sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
looking at pieces of paper stapled together.
FREDDY
What's this?
HOLDAWAY
It's a scene. Memorize it.
FREDDY
What?
HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be
Marlon Brando. To do this job you
got to be a great actor. You got
to be naturalistic. You got to be
naturalistic as hell.
57.
If you ain't a great actor you're a
bad actor, and bad acting is bull
shit in this job.
FREDDY
(referring to the papers)
But what is this?
HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a
drug deal.
FREDDY
What?
HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to
you while you were doing a job.
FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?
HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke. You remember
what's important, and the rest you
make your own. The only way to
make it your own is to keep sayin
it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and
sayin it, and sayin it.
FREDDY
I can do that.
HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details. It's the details that
sell your story. Now this story
takes place in this men's room. So
you gotta know the details about
this men's room. You gotta know
they got a blower instead of a
towel to dry your hands. You gotta
know the stalls ain't got no doors.
You gotta know whether they got
liquid or powdered soap, whether
they got hot water or not, 'cause
if you do your job when you tell
your story, everybody should
believe it. And if you tell your
story to somebody who's actually
taken a piss in this men's room,
and you get one detail they
remember right, they'll swear by
you.
58.
29 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY 29
Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing
the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but he's still
reading it from the page, and every once in a while he
stumbles over his words.
FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86. I still
had a connection. Which was
insane, 'cause you couldn't get
weed anyfuckinwhere then. Anyway,
I had a connection with this hippie
chick up in Santa Cruz. All and my
friends knew it. And they'd give
me a call and say, "Hey, Freddy,
you buyin some, you think you could
buy me some too?" They knew I
smoked, so they'd ask me to buy a
little for them when I was buyin.
But it got to be everytime I bought
some weed, I was buyin for four or
five different people. Finally I
said, "Fuck this shit." I'm makin
this bitch rich. She didn't have
to do jack shit, she never even had
to meet these people. I was fuckin
doin all the work. So I got
together with her and told her,
"Hey, I'm sick of this shit. I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me. So,
either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,
I'll sell it to them, give you the
money, minus ten percent, and I get
my pot for free." So, I did if for
awhile...
Freddy exits frame
CUT TO:
30 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 30
Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence. When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to Holdaway
in a parking lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up
car. Freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story.
59.
FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass. People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time. I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape without
six phone calls interrupting me.
"Hey, Freddy, when's the next time
you're gettin some?"
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin to watch
'Lost Boys'-- when I have some,
I'll let you know." And then these
rinky-dink pot heads come by--
there's my friends and everything,
but still. I got all my shit laid
out in sixty dollar bags. Well,
they don't want sixty dollars
worth. They want ten dollars
worth. Breaking it up is a major
fuckin pain in the ass. I don't
even know how much ten dollars
worth is. "Well, fuck, man, I
don't want that much around. If I
have that much around I'll smoke
it." "Hey, if you guys can't
control your smokin, that's not my
problem. You motherfuckers been
smokin for five years, be a adult
about it." Finally I just told my
connection, count me out. But as
it turns out, I'm the best guy she
had, and she depended alot on my
business. But I was still sick to
death of it. And she's trying to
talk me into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything. People were livin on resin and smokin
the wood in their pipes for months. And this chick had a
bunch, and was beggin me to sell it. So I told her I wasn't
gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore. But I would take a little
bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends. She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as
before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as I helped
her out that weekend. She had a brick of weed she was
sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone...
CUT TO:
31 INT. BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT 31
Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy continues his
story. The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.
60.
FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county
unexpectedly.
MR. WHITE
What for?
FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something,
found the warrants on 'im, took 'im
to jail. She doesn't want to walk
around alone with all that weed.
Well, I don't wanna do this, I have
a bad feeling about it, but she
keeps askin me, keeps askin me,
finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick
of listening to it. Well, we're
picking this guy up at the train
station.
JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station? You're carrying the
weed on you?
FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why. So we get to the
train station, and we're waitin for
the guy. Now I'm carrying the weed
in one of those carry-on bags, and
I gotta take a piss. So I tell the
connection I'll be right back, I'm
goin' to the little boys room...
CUT TO:
32 INT. MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY 32
MEDIUM ON FREDDY
He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder. Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks. We

FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?
61.
FREEZE FRAME
on Freddy standing in front of six
Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one
German Shepherd. All of their eyes
are on Freddy. Everyone is frozen.
FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.
NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?
FREDDY (V.O.)
No. They were just a bunch of cops
hangin out in the men's room,
talkin. When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they
were talking about and looked at
me.
33 BACK TO BAR 33
ECU MR. WHITE
MR. WHITE
That's hard, man. That's a fuckin
hard situation.
34 BACK TO MEN'S ROOM 34
ECU GERMAN SHEPHERD
barking his head off.
FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts barkin'.
He's barkin' at me. I mean it's
obvious he's barkin' at me.
We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. We can
hear the dog barking.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my
senses, the blood in my veins,
everything I has was screaming,
"Take off, man, just take off, get
the fuck outta there!" Panic hit
me like a bucket of water. First
there was the shock of it--BAM,
right in the face! Then I'm just
standin there drenched in panic.

CAMERA does a PAN from face to face
of the sheriffs.
FREDDY (V.O.)
And all those sheriffs are lookin
at me and they know. They can smell
it. As sure as that fuckin dog
cam, they can smell it on me.
FREEZE FRAME
Back to the same freeze frame shot
of Freddy standing in front of the
sheriffs. It suddenly jerks to
life, and
moves to speed. The dog is barking. Freddy moves to his
right, out of frame. We stay on the sheriffs. One sheriff
yells at the dog.
SHERIFF #1
Shut up!
The dog quiets down. Sheriff #2 continues with his story. A
couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen, but
as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.
SHERIFF #2
So my gun's drawn, right? I got it
aimed right at him. I tell 'em,
"Freeze, don't fuckin move." And
the little idiot's lookin at me,
nodding his head "Yes," sayin "I
know...I know...I know." Meanwhile
his right hand is creepin towards
his glove box. So I scream at him,
"Asshole, you better fuckin freeze
right now!" And he's still lookin
right at me, saying
"I know...I know...I know." And his right hand's still
going for the glove box.
The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up against
the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.
SHERIFF #2 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna shoot
you in the face right now if you
don't put your hands on the fuckin
dash." And the guy's girlfriend, a
real sexy Oriental bitch, starts
screamin at him, "Chuck, are you
out of your mind?
63.
Put your hands on the dash like the
officer said." And then like
nothing, the guy snaps out of it
and casually puts his hands on the
dash.
Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the
sheriffs over to the sink. The CAMERA PANS with him. A
sheriff is sitting on a sink. He looks down and watches
Freddy wash his hands.
SHERIFF #1
What was he goin for?
SHERIFF #2
His registration. Stupid fuckin
citizen, doesn't have the slightest
idea how close he came to gettin
shot.
Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them, but
there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns on
the drying machine. He can't hear anything the sheriffs say
now. The sound of the machine dominates the sound track.
These following shots are SLOW MOTION.
CU OF FREDDY
CU of his HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry
SHOT OF SHERIFFS talking. We can't hear them because of the
machine.
CU OF MACHINE

FREDDY (OS)
That's him, that's Mr. White.

FULL SCENE
An office upstairs in the
undercover division of the police
station.
TWO SHOT OF FREDDY AND HOLDAWAY
look at mug shot.
HOLDAWAY
Lawrence Dimick. Let's see what we
got on him.
CU OF COMPUTER SCREEN
the name DIMICK, LAWRENCE is typed in.
C.U. ENTER BUTTON IS PRESSED
C.U. OF FEMALE COMPUTER OPERATOR, JODIE SEIGEL.
JODIE
This is your life, Lawrence Dimick!
C.U. OF COMPUTER PRINTER
printing out sheet. The noise of the printer plays loud
over the soundtrack. Jodie's hand comes into FRAME and tears
sheet from the printer.
CUT TO:
36 INT. HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY 36
Holdaway sits behind his desk. Freddy sits on the edge of
the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese. They look into
the CAMERA.
We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.
JODIE (OS)
Lawrence "Larry" Dimick. Also
known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
"Al" Jacobs. This guy is Mr. Joe-
Armed-Robbery. He's a pro and he
makes it a habit not to get caught.
MEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE
DOLLY slowly into C.U.
65.
JODIE
He's only been convicted twice,
which is pretty good for somebody
living a life of crime. Once for
armed robbery, when he was twentyone,
in Milwaukee.
C.U. FREDDY
FREDDY
What was it?
JODIE
JODIE
Payroll office at a lumber yard. First offense - he got
eighteen months. He didn't get busted again until he was
thirty-two. And then it was a backdoor bust. A routine vice
squad roust. They roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence is in
there knocking down a few. He gets picked up. He's wearing
on his person an outlaw .45 automatic, apparently his weapon
of choice. Also, on his finger is a diamond ring from a
jewelry store robbery a year earlier. He got two years back
inside for that.
TWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY
Freddy winces.
FREDDY
Goddamn, that's hard time.
JODIE
JODIE
So far, it's the only time he's ever done.
CU HOLDAWAY
HOLDAWAY
Was this vice squad bullshit in
Milwaukee?
JODIE
JODIE
No. The vice squad roust was in L.A. He's been in Los
Angeles since '77.
DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK
from left to right.
66.
FREDDY
When did he do this time?
JODIE
Back in '83, got out late '86. I
found something else out I think
you two should be aware of. About a
year and a half ago, up in
Sacramento, an undercover cop, John
Dolenz, worked his way into a bank
job. Apparently before the job
they found out he was a cop. Now
picture this: It's Dolenz's
birthday, a bunch of cops are
waiting in his apartment for a
surprise party. The door opens,
everyone yells "Surprise!", and
standing in the doorway is Dolenz
and this other guy sticking a gun
in Dolenz's ribs. Before anybody
knows what's going on, this
stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
starts firing two .45 automatics
into the crowd.
HOLDAWAY
What happened?
The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.
JODIE
It was a mess. Cops got hit, wives
got hit, girlfriends got hit, his
dog got hit. People got glass in
their faces. Three were killed,
six were wounded.
FREDDY
They couldn't pin the killing on
one of the bank robbers?
JODIE
They tried, but they didn't have a
positive I.D. and all those guys
had alibis. Besides, we really
didn't have anything on them. We
had the testimony of a dead man
that they were talking about
committing a robbery. They never
went ahead with the bank job.
The DOLLY completes its circle.
67.
FREDDY
And Larry Dimick was one of the
boys?
JODIE
He was probably the one.
ON HOLDAWAY
HOLDAWAY
Just how sure are you with your
cover?
PAN to C.U. on Freddy.
FREDDY
Today they may know something,
tomorrow they may know something
else. But yesterday they didn't
know anything.
C.U. OF MR. WHITE'S MUG SHOT
FREDDY (OS)
What's the next step?
HOLDAWAY (OS)
Do what they told ya. Sit in your
apartment and wait for 'em to call
you. We'll have guys posted
outside who'll follow you when they
pick you up.
35 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY 35

FREDDY (OS)

I'll be right down.
We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone.
Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.
EDDIE
He'll be right down.
39 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY 39
The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment
getting everything he needs. He puts on his jacket and
slips on some sneakers.
DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand comes
into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE UP to his
face.
Fear.
FREDDY
(to himself)
Don't pussy out on me now. They
don't know. They don't know shit.
(pause)
You're not gonna get hurt. You're
fucking Baretta and they believe
every word, cuz
you're super cool.
He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and close
OFF SCREEN.
40 EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY 40
COPS' POV
From inside an unmarked car across
the street, the TWO
COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and up
to Eddie's parked car.
COP #1 (OS)
There goes our boy.
COP #2 (OS)
I swear, a guy has to have rocks in
his head the size of Gibraltar to
work undercover.
69.
COP #1 (OS)
Do you want one of these?
COP #2 (OS)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.
Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.
Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.
41 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY 41
Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is in the
passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the backseat
together.
MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
about, black women ain't the same
as white women.
MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.
The car laughs.
MR. PINK
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I
mean. What a while bitch will put
up with, a black bitch won't put up
with for a minute. They got a
line, and if you cross it, they
fuck you up.
EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this. I've seen it happen.
MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a
truism, how come every nigger I
know treats his woman like a piece
of shit?
MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those same
damn niggers who were showin their
ass in public, when their bitches
get 'em home, they chill the fuck
out.
MR. WHITE
Not these guys.
70.
MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.
EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story. In
one of daddy's clubs there was this
black cocktail waitress named
Elois.
MR. WHITE
Elois?
EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called
her Lady E.
MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?
EDDIE
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills. I knew
this lady from Ladora Heights once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."
EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper. I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once. You know who
she looked like? Christie Love.
'Member that TV show "Get Christie
Love"? She was a black female cop.
She always used to say "You're
under arrest, sugar."
MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on. I totally dug it.
What the fuck was the name of the
chick who played Christie Love?
EDDIE
Pam Grier.
71.
MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
was the other one. Pan Grier made
the movies. Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam
Grier.
MR. PINK (CONT’D)
What the fuck was that chick's
name? Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now.
EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked
like her. So one night I walk into
the club, and no Elois. Now the
bartender was a wetback, he was a
friend of mine, his name was
Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well
apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog
shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so
things to her.
FREDDY
Do things? What would he do? You
mean like beat her up?
EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk. So one
night the guy gets drunk and passes
out on the couch. So while the
guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked. Then she takes some crazy
glue and glues his dick to his belly.
The car reacts to how horrible that would be.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
I'm dead fuckin serious. She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together. The
paramedics had to come and cut it
loose.
The car reacts badly.
72.
MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!
FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.
EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her,
but she got even.
MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?
MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to do
a handstand every time you took a
piss.
The car laughs.
42 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 42
Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse. The four men
climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.
43 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 43
The four men enter the building.
At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.
We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.
JOE
(to everybody)
...So they're talkin about how they
get their wives off, and the French
guys says:
(in a bad French accent)
"All I gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
la and she rises a foot off the
bed."
Back to Joe.
So the dago says:
73.
CU ON JOE
JOE
(in a good Brooklyn
accent)
"That's nothin. When I take the
tip of my tongue and wiggle it
against my Mary Louise's little fun
pimple, she rises two feet off da
bed." Then our friend from Poland
says:
(in dumb voice)
"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When I
get through fuckin my Sophie, I
wipe my dick on the curtains and
you know what? She hits the roof!"
Joe laughs like a crazy man.
JOE (CONT’D)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.
JOE (CONT’D)
Ain't that a masterpiece? Stupid
fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
the drapes.
Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.
JOE (CONT’D)
You're here, great!
Joe EXITS C.U.
We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
scene together again. Some sit on folding chairs, some
stand. Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table. A
blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to the
right.
We do a 360 around the men.
EDDIE
We woulda gotten here sooner, but
we got backed up around La Brea and
Pico.
JOE
No hurry.
(to the boys)
All right, let's get to know one
another.
74.
With the exception of Eddie and
myself, who you already know,
you'll be using aliases. Under no
circumstances are you to tell one
another your real name or anything
else about yourself. That includes
where you're from, your wife's
name, where you might've done time,
about a bank in St. Petersburg you
might've robbed. You guys don't
say shit about who you are, where
you been or what you've done. Only
thing you guys can talk about is
what you're going to do. This way
the only ones who know who the
members of the team are are Eddie
and myself. And that's the way I
like it. Because in the unlikely
event of one of you getting
apprehended by the cops, not that I
expect that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with. You don't
know any names. You know my name,
you know Eddie's name. That I
don't care about. You gotta prove
it. I ain't worried. Besides,
this way you gotta trust me. I
like that. I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.
None of you came to me, I
approached all of you. I know you.
I know your work, I know your
reputation. I know you as men.
Except for this guy.
Joe points a finger at Freddy.
Freddy shits a brick.
JOE (CONT’D)
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here. Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of
being redundant, if I even think I
hear somebody telling or referring
to somebody by their Christian
name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you. Okay,
quickly.
75.
(pointing at the men as
he gives them a name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?
JOE
Cause you're a faggot.
Everybody laughs.
MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own
colors?
JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since
nobody knows anybody else, nobody
wants to back down. So forget it,
I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr.
Yellow.
MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too
close to Mr. Shit.
Everybody laughs.
MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
Pussy. Tell you what, let me be
Mr. Purple. That sounds good to
me, I'm Mr. Purple.
JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
from another job's Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink.
MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is? Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White. You gotta
cool-sounding name. So tell me,
Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
is no big deal, you wanna trade?
76.
JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meeting! Listen up
Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my
way or the highway. And you can go
down either of 'em. So what's it
gonna be, Mr. Pink?
MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin forget
it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr.
Pink, let's move on.
CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the
layout of the jewelry store on it.
JOE (OS)
Okay fellas, let's get into this.
CUT TO:
44 EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY 44
Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little
league baseball field.
HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry. But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control. You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in. You're inside to make
sure that everything goes according
to Hoyle. We have men set up a
block away from the warehouse
rendezvous. They got complete
visibility of the exterior. So as
soon as Joe Cabot shows up, we'll
see it.
FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?
HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any closer
for fear they'll spot us.
77.
FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim. I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.
HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke? Job
too tough for ya? No one lied to
you. You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.
FREDDY
Oh this is great. You ain't giving
me no fuckin protection whatsoever.
But you are giving me an attitude.
HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection? Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes wide
open, so don't start screamin blind
man now. I understand you're
nervous. I wish the warehouse had
more visible windows, but it
doesn't. We have to make do with
the cards we're dealt.
FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!
HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations. We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot. We don't care
about these other bastards. We're
willing to offer them good deals to
testify against Cabot.
FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?
HOLDAWAY
What?
FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?
78.
HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot redhanded.
We bust these hired hands,
we ain't accomplished shit. Letting
them go through with the heist is a
risk, but Cabot's jobs are very
clean. We got people surrounding
the perimeter. We got a guy and a
gal on the inside posing as a
couple shopping for rings. We
could replace the employees with
cops, but we'd run the risk of
tipping 'em off.
FREDDY
That's out. They know the faces of
who works what shift.
HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals. We're
professionals. It's a risk, but I
think it's a calculated risk.
45 EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY 45
We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.
CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.
While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr. White
and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it. Where are you?
FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody come in or go
out.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?
FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
79.
FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control. They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.
46 INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY 46
Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.
MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?
FREDDY
You two take the manager in the
back and make him give you the
diamonds. We're there for those
stones, period. Since no display
cases are being fucked with, no
alarms should go off. We're out of
there in two minutes, not one
second longer. What if the manager
won't give up the diamonds?
MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass. They're not supposed to give
you and resistance whatsoever. If
you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,
take the butt of your gun and smash
their nose in. Drops 'em right to
the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls
down, screaming, blood squirts out
his nose. Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin shit after that.
You might get some bitch talk shit
to ya. But give her a look, like
you're gonna smash her in the face
next. Watch her shut the fuck up.
Now if it's a manager, that's a
different story. The managers know
better than to fuck around. So if
one's givin you static, he probably
thinks he's a real cowboy. So what
you gotta do is break that son-of-abitch
in two. If you wanna know
something and he won't tell you,
cut off one of his fingers. The
little one. Then you tell 'im his
thumb's next.
80.
After that he'll tell ya if he
wears ladies underwear. I'm
hungry, let's get a taco.
CUT TO:
47 EXT. ALLEY - DAY 47
It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.
In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING, glass
BREAKING...
A car whips around the corner, into the alley.
The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.
Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING Mr.
Brown FALLS out.
MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!
FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.
Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics. He RUNS to the end
of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.
FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.
Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr. White's
ambush in shock.
Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.
MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?
By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown is
dead.
Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.
MR. WHITE
Is he dead?
Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.
81.
MR. WHITE (CONT’D)
Did he did or not?
Freddy, scared.
FREDDY
I'm sorry.
MR. WHITE
What? Snap out of it!
Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as he
RUNS.
They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.
A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.
Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car. He points
his jun at her.
MR. WHITE (CONT’D)
Get us outta here!
Mr. White climbs into the backseat.
Freddy starts to climb in.
The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.
MR. WHITE (CONT’D)
The bitch's got a gun!
She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.
On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.
C.U. ON FREDDY
as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened to him
and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.
Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.
48 INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY 48
Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
CRYING.
We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.
82.
MR. WHITE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.
FREDDY
I'm sorry. I can't believe she
killed me...
CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:
49 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY 49
Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
passenger seat going through the satchel with the diamonds.
Mr. White is in the backseat. The car is SPEEDING back to
the garage.
EDDIE
(looking through the
case)
You know, all things considered,
this was pretty successful.
MR. WHITE
I don't believe you just said that.
EDDIE
No, it was messy as hell, but do
you realize how much you got away
with? There's over two million
dollars worth of diamonds here.
MR. PINK
I love this guy.
EDDIE
Hey, what's done is done. We can
all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand.
MR. WHITE
The situation as hand isn't that
fuckin satchel. You and Joe have a
responsibility to your men.
EDDIE
Hey, it's the best I could do.
MR. WHITE
The man is fucking dying.
EDDIE
And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll take
care of him.
83.
MR. WHITE
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
nurse.
EDDIE
Ask me how many doctors I called.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
me how many doctors I called.
MR. WHITE
Obviously not enough.
EDDIE
Fuck you! You gotta little black
book, then whip is out. If not,
listen how it is. I called three
doctors and couldn't get through to
shit. Now, time being a factor, I
called Bonnie. Sweet broad,
helluva broad, and a registered
nurse. Told her a bullshit story,
upside: she said bring him to her
apartment.
MR. WHITE
If he dies I'm holding you
personally responsible.
EDDIE
Fuck you buddy boy! Okay, you
wanna play that way. I am
personally leaving myself
vulnerable with this Bonnie
situation. I don't think she'll
call the cops, but I don't know for
sure. But me being too nice- afuckin-
guy was willin to risk it.
But no fuckin more.
(he grabs his portable
phone)
I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
her to forget it. You take care of
your friend, you know so much about
it.
MR. PINK
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!
EDDIE
I don't need to grow up, my friend.
I am a grown up. I'm being
responsible, I'm taking care of
business.
84.
MR. WHITE
Cut the shit! I don't think you
called anybody except some cooze
you once fucked, who happens to
wear orthopedic shoes. And I don't
think that's good enough care for a
gut-shot man.
EDDIE
Yeah, well I don't give a flying
fuck what you think!
MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
gonna operate on him. She's gonna
give him better attention than we
can until we can get a doctor.
Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
Joe'll get one in a snap. This is
something we're doing in the
meantime. I think both of you are
actin like a couple of assholes.
EDDIE
Yeah, right. I arrange a nurse, I
leave myself wide open, and I'm an
asshole.
50 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 50
MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr.
Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.
We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot
full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody
mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound.
Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot.
EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?
Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?
MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and was
gonna burn him alive.
85.
EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin pig?
Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and the
chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once
more.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that? Worse or
better?
MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through
the door, he was gonna blow you to
hell and make off with the
diamonds.
MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That
sick piece of shit was a stone cold
psycho.
MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him. He talked
about what he was going to do when
he was slicing him up.
EDDIE
I don't buy it. It doesn't make
sense.
MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin sense to
me. Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.
Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.
MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's
hacked off.
86.
EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind.
According to you, Mr. Blonde was
gonna kill you. Then when we came
back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
and scram. That's your story? I'm
correct about that, right?
MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth. I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.
The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.
There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has
said. Finally:
EDDIE
You're a fuckin liar. Now why
don't you drop the fuckin fairy
tale and tell me what really
happened?
MR. WHITE (OS)
He told you what really happened.
You just can't deal with it.
MR. ORANGE (OS)
Okay, you're right, I'm lying. Even
though I'm fuckin dyin I'm not
above pullin a fast one. Get rid
of Blonde, we share his split - no,
scratch that, I shot him 'cause I
didn't like his hair style. I
didn't like his shoes either. If
it has just been his hair, I'd've
maybe, maybe I said, let him live.
But hair and footwear together,
he's a goner.
EDDIE
The man you killed was just
released from prison. He got
caught at a company warehouse full
of hot items. He could've walked
away. All he had to do was say my
dad's name. But instead he shut
his mouth and did his time. He did
four years for us, and he did 'em
like a man.
87.
And we were very grateful. So, Mr.
Orange, you're tellin me this very
good friend of mine, who did four
years for my father, who in four
years never made a deal, no matter
what they dangled in front of him,
you're telling me that now, that
now this man is free, and we're
making good on our commitment to
him, he's just gonna decide, right
out of the fuckin blue, to rip us
off?
Silence.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?
VOICE (OS)
Why? It'll just be more bullshit.
Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing in
the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.
JOE
(pointing to Mr. Orange)
This man set us up.
CAMERA does a 360 around the men.
EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening.
JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking
about?
JOE
(pointing to Mr. Orange)
That piece of shit. Workin with
the cops.
MR. WHITE MR. PINK EDDIE
What?
JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin
with the LAPD.
88.
MR. ORANGE'S POV
Looking up from the floor at everybody.
Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.
JOE
Aren't you?
MR. ORANGE (OS)
I don't have the slightest fuckin
idea what you're talkin about.
MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.
JOE
Like hell I am.
MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made
a mistake. He's a good kid. I
understand you're hot, you're superfuckin
pissed. We're all real
emotional. But you're barking up
the wrong tree. I know this man,
and he wouldn't do that.
JOE
You don't know jack shit. I do.
This rotten bastard tipped off the
cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue
killed.
MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?
JOE
Dead as Dillinger.
EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.
MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?
JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a
hundred percent on.
89.
I should have my fucking head
examined for goin forward when I
wasn't a hundred percent. But he
seemed like a good kid, and I was
impatient and greedy and all the
things that fuck you up.
MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?
JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct. I ignored it before, but
not no more.
He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.
Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.
Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms.
Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.
EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Put your gun down!
Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.
MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible
mistake I can't let you make.
EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
daddy!
Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.
JOE
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot. We like each
other too much.
MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next. Repeat, if you kill that
man, you die next!
We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.
90.
MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY
Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.
Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off
him.
Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to start
firing any minute.
Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
White.
Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.
Nobody says nothing.
FOUR SHOT
of guys ready for violence. Mr.
Pink in the B.G.
MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
We're supposed to me fuckin
professionals!
Joe raises his head to Mr. White.
JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!
JOE
Larry, I'm askin you to trust me on
this.
MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.
JOE
I'm not askin, I'm betting.
Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.
EDDIE
Daddy, don't!
Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.
Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his
hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.
91.
Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.
Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.
The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.
Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.
Joe's dead.
Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
heaving. The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.
Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees, not
moving.
Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the
satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.
We hear outside a CAR START. Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
yells out:
POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
face down on the ground!
MR. PINK (OS)
Don't shoot!
We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP, MEN
RUNNING to the warehouse.
While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
lies.
He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.
MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid. Looks like we're gonna
do a little time.
Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an effort:
MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.
Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.
92.
MR. ORANGE (CONT’D)
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.
The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.
The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see anything,
but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.
POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your
fucking gun!
Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.
BANG
We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.
Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
93.

Death Proof
By Quentin Tarantino
Page 1/51
Hold on, I gotta come up!
I've gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.
We can't be late!
We won't!
Who's... who's holding?
If you 're not, then nobody.
We were kind of hoping you were.
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.
You 're gettin' angry kind of quick,
don't you think?
I was just teasin' you!
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.
Are you through
having a tantrum?
I'm not having a tantrum.
Yes, you are. You've been
in the car all of two seconds,
and you 're already cursing at me.
I am not cursing at you.
You said "Jesus Christ, Shanna,"
and then before
the sentence was over
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your irritatedness.
Come on, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.
And two, we're not really fighting.
Arlene, you've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.
Page 2/51
That wasn't a fight.
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.
Oh! Billboard!
So, what's the plan, man?
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?
- Of course.
- You 're so good.
I know.
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?
You bet your ass he is...
with Jesse Letterman.
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.
He's got a big thing for Julia.
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me,
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does.
And on my birthday
he'd give me a fucking phone call.
Oh, billboard!
Yeah, but you get
those legs of yours around him,
and it's all over.
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills that I am also living in,
I'll let you know it worked.
So, margaritas
and Mexican food at Guero's,
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,
and make damn sure they come.
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.
Page 3/51
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...
what happened
with you and Nate last night?
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they're never gonna respect you.
Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?
Oh, nothing to write home about.
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing. "
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?
You know, it's everything but.
They call that "the thing"?
I call it "the thing. "
Do guys like "the thing"?
They like it better than "no thing. "
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.
So you 're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?
Correct.
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?
I was straddling him.
What else?
That was it. So we made out
for a little while on the couch...
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave. "
Page 4/51
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"
And I said,
"Yup, right now. Let's go. "
And he says, "Wait, what about this?"
And I said no.
He said, "What do you mean?
You don't know what I'm gonna say. "
I said, "I already know what you 're
gonna say, and the answer's no. "
He said, "Well, how can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"
And I said, "Because you 're gonna say,
'Let's just go to sleep together.
'We don't gotta do nothing.
'Just cuddle,
sleep next to each other,
wake up in the morning together. "'
"No. You 're gonna leave...
but I'll see you tomorrow. "
Yeah, fuck Nate.
I mean, he's cute and all,
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.
Remember...
no hookin' up tonight.
You can hang out with them,
you can make out with them,
but no hookin' up with them,
because we are driving
to Lake L.B.J. tonight,
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing...
He said, "I am lettin' you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,
not you and a bunch of horny boys
trying to get their fuck on with my daughter. "
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah.
And it's not like
he ain't gonna know, either,
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
Page 5/51
and make sure we don't need anything.
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear!
But you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang
walking the floor of his lake house,
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.
And if you flirt shamelessly with him,
like the six-foot baby giraffe
in the backseat,
you got a puppy dog for life.
I have my own relationship with Ben,
and you 're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.
You call her dad "Ben"?
I'm not a child.
That's his name.
So, when are the boys
showing up?
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.
Maybe they can bring some pot.
Fuck that. No.
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,
or B, depending on their ass.
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,
we're gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.
Best idea you had all day.
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!
Oh, come on, give me a break.
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.
Okay.
Jules, let me get a drag.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Hey, this is...
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.
Hey.
Page 6/51
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.
Ooh...
So, you must be... must be...
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.
Shh!
She don't know nothing about it.
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?
- Soon.
- Tell me what?
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we've gotta tell her sooner than later.
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.
What did you say
and what did you say I'd do?
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,
or Marcy over here,
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.
Okay, so just tell me your way.
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
Page 7/51
- Sure.
Okay, give Marcy your drink.
Okay, so you 're
in a club or a bar,
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,
but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.
Got it.
Okay, Marcy, take it.
Howdy.
Hi, there.
Excuse me, but...
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly," would it?
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.
Barry.
Pleased to meet you, Barry.
Y'all are gettin' me hot!
Shh!
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?
Yes, it is.
And how'd you know
my name, Barry?
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this mornin'.
Oh, you did, did you?
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.
Oh, you do, do you?
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.
She got a black girl's ass.
Well, that's what she always says,
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.
Page 8/51
She's got a big ass.
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.
Okay, we'll get to the point,
but for your information,
skinny bitch,
black men and a whole lot
of motherfuckin' white men
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.
If you 're not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
So, Butterfly...
can I buy you a drink?
I'd love one.
What can I get ya?
I'll take a margarita.
Here ya go.
So, after they buy you a drink
when they raise
their glass to toast,
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem...
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep. "
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
"Miles to go before you sleep. "
And then, if they say that...
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.
What?
If they call you "Butterfly,"
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothin'.
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,
Page 9/51
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin
thinking you 're a chicken shit.
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be funny!
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.
I said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.
But maybe a little later
in the evening,
you've had a few drinks,
you 're kind of loosey-goosey,
you 're safe with your girls,
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.
She's making me trip.
Shut the fuck up.
You made me trip, dumb bitch!
You fuckin' idiot!
Any dead soldiers here?
Uh, these two. Thank you.
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?
That's a good fucking question.
Lanna-Frank!
Where are you?
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.
Page 10/51
Shit! Hold on!
So, where are you?
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.
No. We're not coming over there.
You come over here
like you said you would.
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. I...
No.
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.
We all hate the name "Shauna,"
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna. "
Just remember...
it's "Shanna Banana,"
not "Shauna Banauna. "
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.
- Warren says it, we do it!
I love that philosophy!
"Warren says it, we do it. "
So let's do it!
What is it?
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!
Mmm!
Whoo-hoo!
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?
What the fuck is it?!
Chartreuse.
Page 11/51
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?
Not me.
I'm going out for a smoke.
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?
You'll blow up the joint.
Drinks.
What can we get you?
Shanna Banana?
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.
Good boy.
Oh, hey, Punky.
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
- Whoa-ho!
You scared the fuck out of me,
you shitty asshole!
I swear, Arlene.
I was not trying to scare you.
I just... got lucky.
Oh, hardee-fucking-har.
- Let's go inside.
- Wait a minute.
- Why?
- I was thinkin' we could make out.
What, on a porch?
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.
Not in my car it's not.
Look, you won't get wet.
I promise you.
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.
Ha ha ha.
Page 12/51
I mean...
you know what I mean.
Look, I know you guys
are going to Lake L.B.J.
and we can't come.
I wanna make out...
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.
I don't want it super fucking obvious
to everybody in the bar we've been gone,
- so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
- Great.
No, no, no.
Deal or no deal?
If you 're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,
we could just walk back
inside the fucking bar right now.
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.
And no begging.
When you say "done," it's done.
I'm gonna remember
you said that.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, you got two jobs... kiss good
and make sure my hair don't get wet.
Now, look, you can't look like
you 're trying to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up,
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.
Yeah, but what's the point?
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,
and it's no guys.
Absolutely no guys.
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.
You think they're gonna fall for that?
We'll be very convincing.
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
Page 13/51
No more fucking around.
We go to Jger shots.
Man, they're not gonna drink Jger shots.
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,
a fucking bitch
will drink anything.
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jger
down these
fucking bitches' throats.
After that, we'll see if they get
another Jger shot in them.
You never know.
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it. "
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.
My point exactly.
And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana"
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
What's Julia's sweet shot?
- Key Lime Pie.
- Oh, come on, dude.
Even fucking Leroy Brown
would do one more for dessert.
Dude, check it out.
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.
Jesus.
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.
Hi, could I get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace, please?
And where did you two disappear to?
I had to get something
out of the car,
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.
Ah, good for you, Nate.
You see that pretty girl
Page 14/51
sitting by herself at the bar?
Who, the dirty hippie?
Meow. She's not a hippie.
She might as well be a hippie.
Thank you, Timmy boy.
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?
What about her?
Hey, Warren!
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.
You've been eavesdropping?
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear. "
I think I belong
in the latter category.
So, uh, Icy Hot.
You 're offering me a ride home?
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.
And when are you
thinking about leaving?
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?
I know looks can be deceiving.
But I'm a teetotaler.
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night,
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.
- Which is what?
- Virgin pia colada.
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink
spend hours at a bar drinking water?
Page 15/51
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.
Mmm. Really?
Like what?
Women.
Nacho grande platters.
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,
like Warren here.
Alcohol is just a lubricant
for all the individual
encounters that a barroom offers.
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.
I'm a stuntman.
But that's a very
easy mistake to make.
How do you know my name?
When you were talking with Warren...
couldn't help but overhear.
Fair enough.
So what's your name, Icy?
Stuntman Mike.
Stuntman Mike's your name?
Tsk. You ask anybody.
Hey, Warren.
Who is this guy?
Stuntman Mike.
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?
He's a stuntman.
Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Let's do 'em!
Salud.
Down the snatch.
You know, Pam,
I think it's time for my big drink.
Well, Stuntman Mike,
since I have a tab here,
can I buy you that
virgin pia colada?
Thank you, Pam.
Page 16/51
That'd be lovely.
Warren!
A, uh, virgin pia colada
for my stuntman friend
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.
Cabo Wabo, virgin.
- Ah!
- Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.
Mwah.
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?
Hey!
Hey, what's shakin', bacon?
Hey.
It's about fucking time.
Well, beggars can't be choosers.
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.
What?
That table.
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?
Yep.
She sure is a striking-looking woman.
It's got gin, tequila, Jger...
Look at that hair.
Lots of leave-in conditioner.
Is that jealousy I detect?
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,
there's a real easy way to do that.
Really, what would that be?
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she'll find you.
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.
Enjoy it, cocksucker.
You've earned it.
What did she ever do to you?
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.
Page 17/51
That's what she did to me.
She was her height right now at 12.
She was a monster.
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?
That pituitary case?
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man...
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.
Hey! Are you
famous or somethin'?
Or somethin'.
No, no, no. Really.
Hey, what do... what do you do?
Really?
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D.J.
Wait a minute.
You've got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?
Yeah.
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.
Yeah.
Jungle Julia Lucai.
Stuntman Mike McKay.
Well.
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.
Would you care for some?
Thank you, Julia,
but just the same...
no thanks.
- Suit yourself.
- But you know...
Oh, shit.
Ah! My God.
Page 18/51
Sorry. It's nothing.
What the fuck was that?
You got some voucher here.
I asked him
what movies you worked on.
No fuckin' clue.
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.
I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparral.
a guy falls off a horse,
he says it's him.
You know the show The Virginian?
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,
and I looked like him a bit...
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.
Tsk. Aww, I like it.
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.
And, uh... then that show turned
into The Men of Shiloh.
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vega$.
I was Robert Urich's driving double.
And then Bob
did another show, Gavilan.
and he brought me
with him on that, till...
And after that...
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talkin' about?
Sorry.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
No, no.
So how exactly does one
Page 19/51
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.
How's that?
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?
Stuntman Bob.
I'm ready to blaze!
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.
Anywho, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?
Mm-hmm.
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?
Mmm, us girls.
Good idea.
Ladies?
Thanks.
Cheers, Butterfly.
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...
"And I have promises to keep,
And miles to go
before I sleep. "
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
"Miles to go
before you sleep. "
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...
Mike.
Page 20/51
Mike.
She already broke off that dance.
Is that true?
Did I miss my chance?
Do I frighten you?
Is it my scar?
It's your car.
Ah, yeah, I know.
Sorry.
It's my mom's car.
Have you been following us?
No, but that's
what I love about Austin...
it's just so damn small.
- You've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.
So you really weren't following us?
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.
So, how about that lap dance?
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?
I'm good that way.
- Tsk. And you look a little touchd.
- What's "touchd"?
Wounded, slightly.
Why should I be wounded?
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.
So...
Page 21/51
How about that lap dance?
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.
Well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,
that rain check'll be worthless.
But that's okay.
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.
You 're still a nice girl.
And I still like you.
But I must warn you of something.
You know how people say,
"You 're okay in my book,"
or, "In my book, that's no good. "
Well, I actually have a book.
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.
And now I've met you,
and you 're goin' in the book.
Except...
I'm afraid I must file you...
under...
"Chicken Shit. "
And what if I did it?
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit,"
then, now, could I?
What's your name again?
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...
I'm Butterfly.
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?
What about "kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,
"hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy
who you could fuck"
did you not understand?
Page 22/51
I'm driving.
We're gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.
Ready to go?
Yeah.
- Bye.
Bye.
I think you got Mike laid tonight.
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!
He's just giving me a ride.
Oh, no doubt.
Have a nice ride!
Look, double fucks.
I am not gonna fuck him.
I can hear you.
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.
Bye.
Bye-bye!
Wow, that's fucking scary.
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...
scary tends to impress.
Is it safe?
No, it's better than safe.
It's death-proof.
How do you make a car death-proof?
Well, that's what stuntmen do.
You've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?
Yeah.
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?
CGI?
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you 're right.
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothin' days...
Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,
the White Line Fever days...
real cars smashing into real cars.
Page 23/51
Real dumb people driving 'em.
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...
Voila!
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.
Just for the experience.
Why is your passenger seat in a box?
Well, this is a movie car.
Sometimes when you 're shootin' a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car...
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box. "
There you go.
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes. "
But look at the bright side, Pam...
I won't be gettin' fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.
That is a bright side.
I thought so.
Well, Pam...
which way are you going?
- Left or right?
- Right.
Ah, that's too bad.
Why?
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you'd be going left or right.
You see, we're both going left.
Page 24/51
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,
and if that was the case,
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.
But since
you 're going the other way,
I'm afraid...
you 're gonna
have to start getting scared...
immediately.
What the fuck?!
Cocksucking motherfucker!
Just fucking let me out of here!
I'll fucking rip your fucking...
Stop the fucking car!
Why are you being such a shit?
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I get it.
I... I know it's a joke,
and super funny.
Um, but if you just stop right now,
you know, and... and let me out,
I'll never tell anybody
because I know it's a joke.
I know all about jokes.
Ha ha ha!
I promise everything'll be fine.
Just... just... just let me out.
Please?
- And... and... and...
- Hey, Pam!
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?
Well, that wasn't a lie.
This car is 100% death proof.
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...
you really need to be sittin' in my seat.
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.
Page 25/51
So, you got it?
Thanks, honey.
You 're gonna play it next song, right?
Good boy.
Growl!
Bye-bye.
Who do you want to hear?
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
Who?
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
Who the fuck are they?
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,
he would have ended up in this group,
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.
And if you ask me,
he should have.
That's my boy!
I want to hear
this part of the song louder!
Do you remember anything?
Uh... I... I don't remember.
Doctor Block.
Self-restraints to Room 310.
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?
I don't really see
it's any of your business.
Come on now, Sis.
You just tell us.
How bad is he?
He got banged up real good.
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.
Is that it?
He was real lucky.
That'll be all?
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.
Page 26/51
Son of a bitch.
So, Pop.
What do you think?
Well, Son Number One,
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.
Well, give it a shot.
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Not a goddamn thing.
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floatin' on weed,
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatively murdered them gals?
Well, I can't prove it.
But since thinkin' don't cost nothin',
I can think it, and I do.
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn...
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.
Did any of 'em survive?
Shit.
Two tons of metal,
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...
they all princess died.
Why?
Well, I'd guesstimate
it's a sex thing.
The only way I can figure it.
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,
Page 27/51
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.
That was just plain old,
goddamn reckless endangerment.
But I got me a goddamn bartender
gonna testify that ol' Stuntman
Mike didn't drink a drop all night.
And his passenger
was left stranded by her date,
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.
Now, on paper, this is gonna look
like he was just trying to help her out.
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.
So, what are you gonna do, Pop?
Tsk.
Well, I could take it
upon myself to work the case,
Search for evidence,
you know, prove my theory.
Alert authorities.
Dog that rotten son of a bitch...
wherever he goes, I go.
Or I could spend the same
goddamn amount of time and energy
following the NASCAR circuit.
Hmm. I've thought about it a lot.
I think I'd have a hell
of a lot happier life if I did the latter.
And just because I can't
punish Old Frankenstein
in there for what he's done,
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John...
if he ever does it again,
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.
Page 28/51
Are you on the same floor as him?
No, he's on the fourth.
- And who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.
And so what happened then?
We made out for about ten minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.
- So how's the Rock as a kisser?
- Mm, he's damn good.
He's got them mushy lips,
smooth fingertips.
Mm, I love them mushy lips.
He's a big guy, so he spins me around
so my back is up against him,
takes his big hand
and puts it on my throat,
tilts my head back and leans over me,
kisses me from behind.
Damn, that sounds sexy!
It was sexy.
But then that was it?
You sent him off? How'd he take it?
Wait a minute, what are we doing here?
If I'm gonna power through and pick up
Zo at the airport, I need coffee.
Since you 're getting that, can you get
some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?
We didn't know you were awake.
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.
But get some more vodka
and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.
And some Red Apple Tans.
Damn, I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries.
- You remember how to get to the airport?
Uh-huh.
Then you should get behind the wheel,
'cause you gonna drive.
Motherfuckers.
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.
G.O.
G.O.!
Page 29/51
Where the hell are my keys?
Here they are.
Sorry, I didn't mean to give
you a concert there.
No, it wasn't you.
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.
I don't know why,
but that kind of creeped me out.
Little dick.
Clearly.
Since I'm up,
I might as well hit the ATM.
Get me a fuckin' smoke.
What?
Did you just see the...
What?
Nothing, honey.
Y'ello.
It's me.
Miss me?
You best get your ass
off Kim's car.
- I've seen Kim sit on it before.
- Her ass ain't your ass.
Okay. So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.
You got Allure?
Magazines by the window.
Here you are!
You hot mama, you.
See you in a second.
$3.85... out of 20.
And you get 16 and change back.
Thank you very much.
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.
Thought I'd ask.
- Thanks anyway.
- Have a good one.
I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.
Page 30/51
This month's?
Listen to this.
The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.
- No way.
- Way!
I can't believe fuckin' Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about per diem here.
We found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.
We're lucky he's not asking
for fuckin' Krugerrands.
I'm getting it, and we're
splitting it three ways.
What, me, you, and Kim?
Kim doesn't give
a shit about Italian Vogue.
but Brandy'll come in with us,
and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.
Okay, but if anybody tears out
any sheets I want,
you gotta make color Xeroxes
of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.
You take it to the art department
and have them do it fuckin' right.
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
Got it!
...the actress...
Oh, boy.
Your timing couldn't be better, Zo.
It just so happens we're all three
off-duty for the next three days.
Fuckin' hell! How does that happen?
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the four days.
Page 31/51
So how's the shoot going?
Great. We're having the best time.
The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.
So let's hear it, ladies.
Set romances! Who's getting it off?
That would be Lee and Toolbox.
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.
What's his perversion?
He likes to watch me pee.
Ooh!
Yeah, but not no more.
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.
You had a one-off with the Rock?
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.
He looks like the Rock,
so we all just call him the Rock.
Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.
We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage
and Pee Wee Herman, too.
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.
Who'd you steal him from?
Nobody!
Kim!
- Wha... what?
He totally had a girlfriend.
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.
I did not steal him!
Page 32/51
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.
I had a set crush on Cecil.
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!
Oh, it's so funny!
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.
You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.
Oh, well, now you put it like that...
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.
He fucked her on my birthday.
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.
- Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.
What did he get you?
He made me a tape.
He made you a tape?
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?
He made you a tape?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!
Yes, I know what you 're gonna say,
so don't even go there.
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.
Page 33/51
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.
How can you not be on my side?
I admit, that sounds bad.
It is bad!
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.
Were you two fucking?
Hell, no.
Hello, is your name Abernathy?
Sorry.
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.
What do you mean "No, of course not"?
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,
you don't become one
of his girlfriends...
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.
I'd be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!
I've let him give me a foot massage,
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.
Bitch, you might be actin'
like you 12 years old,
but he just acting like a man.
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.
Let me get this straight...
you 're not fucking him,
you 're not sucking him,
you 're not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?
Can we just take my sex life
off the table?
Page 34/51
Actually, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table...
and your lack of one.
Fuck both of you
and your little high-five.
Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job
in the back of the van
on Tuesday.
I'm not gonna do that!
I know you won't!
But you know who will...
the bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.
I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim's said,
but it is true if you've stretched it out
like you have with Cecil
and you suddenly get dirty on them,
it blows their mind.
So Zo, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.
What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked up.
Cheers to that.
- Word.
Cheers.
So Zo...
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"
So I do.
Then "A little fu -ther!"
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...
Page 35/51
...with God knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have broken my neck.
So I am yelling at her:
"Zo, you almost killed me!"
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,
and Zo starts fuckin' around.
And... bam!... if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!
Nice.
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.
I remember taking a step
and looking down,
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about. "
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.
What happened?
What, with Zo, the cat?
Nothing.
If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.
Zo just lands on her feet.
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself...
Zo falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We're laughing about it.
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zo's.
Well, physically speaking,
Zo is amazing.
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zo on that front.
Kim, I like you too.
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zo's prowess,
you 're missing the most
important part of that story.
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Page 36/51
Zo did.
Zo even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,
and she still fell in.
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.
Hey, I resemble that remark.
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?
Check it out, bitch.
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.
What's a Roscoe?
Roscoe's a pistol.
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.
You have a license to carry?
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.
Oh, I didn't know you were...
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.
Did you know Kim carried a gun?
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.
Do I know? Yes.
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.
Don't do your laundry at midnight.
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.
I wanna shut that nigga down!
Page 37/51
How about a knife, at least?
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?
They get shot!
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,
I'll sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.
So Zo, you thought about
what you want to do first?
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.
Oh, really?
And what would that be?
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger...
fuck me swinging, balls out.
Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?
No worries, mate.
I've got it all worked out.
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?
What do you mean by that, mate?
Zo's from New Zealand,
and you never...
I repeat, never...
call a Kiwi an Aussie.
That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.
I'm so sorry. I will nev...
Page 38/51
Oh, it's okay.
We're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.
Auckland, to answer your question.
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?
Pipe down and I'll tell you.
I've been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,
looking at cars for sale,
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.
And you wanna buy it?
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?
Oh, uh, Kowalski!
Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!
If I can get this guy
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.
What's Vanishing Point?
What's Vanishing Point?
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.
Actually, Zo, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.
Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.
Page 39/51
Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...
Vanishing Point. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.
- Gone in 60 Seconds...
- Oh...
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays Vanishing Point.
Big Wednesday. all the classics.
What do you horny gals want?
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?
Right up here, ladies.
This shit is off the fuckin' hook!
Fuckin' legendary, mate.
Sweet ass. Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to have a word with my associate.
You ladies take your time.
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.
What?
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.
Sorry.
Now, what did you say
after the last time?
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.
- But...
Page 40/51
- But, my ass!
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.
Now, did you or did you not say that?
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.
- However...
- Whatever with your "however. "
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it...
Damn skippy you meant it!
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.
You are such a liar!
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I'd ever come to America,
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the Vanishing Point Challenger...
I would have added a "however. "
Right?
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.
I'll be your best friend.
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.
I'll crack your back.
Page 41/51
You'll crack it anyway.
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.
Whenever you want it, you've got it.
You don't even have to ask.
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy. "
You crack my back, give me foot massages,
and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.
Deal.
We're gonna see if this guy'll let us
take the car out without him.
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.
What?
- I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let...
- I heard what you said.
I just can't believe
what you said.
You two got some fuckin' balls.
What?
Don't play dumbass with me.
I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road,
but because Zo wanted to drive
some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.
Now you two got the balls to ask me...
no, scratch that... tell me
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?
Bullshit on that.
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.
You 're not gonna
want to do what we're doing.
What, drive a car?
We're doing more than that.
Page 42/51
What, drive it fast?
We're doing more than that.
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense
- ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
- How do you know?
'Cause you 're a mum.
Yeah.
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,
so what is it you two daredevils are doing
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.
Besides...
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.
Okay, how about this?
I'll talk him into it,
but I go along.
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.
But don't worry.
He'll say yes.
What are you gonna do, blow him?
No.
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.
That's a good one.
Not really.
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?
Okay, Mama, listen up.
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.
We take you along, you don't say shit.
Page 43/51
You don't even say crap.
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.
Agreed.
Okay. Go work your magic.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.
Okay, Abbie.
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we're comfortable.
Why would I do something
stupid like that?
To better sell your automobile.
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?
Four reasons, actually.
One, we're not thieves,
two, that would be rude,
three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town...
you can call, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.
Actually, Zo's not, but Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.
Who's Kim? The colored girl?
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.
And reason number four...
and the most important:
while we're taking the car out
Page 44/51
for a little spin,
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...
Lee.
Why does she look
kind of familiar?
That would be because
she's a famous actress.
Hmm.
Why's she dressed like that?
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.
What's a cheerleader movie?
A movie about cheerleaders.
Is it a porno movie?
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.
Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.
Ta-ta!
Gulp.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I think I'm thinking it.
What are you and you thinking?
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.
I gotta take a...
So, you ready to do this?
You sure?
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.
Kim!
- I'm just saying.
- If you 're gonna take the piss out of it...
I'm just saying.
Page 45/51
You wanna start out on top?
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.
Here are your gloves.
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.
This is my jacket.
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.
Give me your belt.
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.
Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.
Come on, give her the belt.
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?
Just 'cause you asked nicely.
It's nice to be nice, Kim!
Whatever.
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You'll ask "pretty please," bitch,
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.
Don't get on my nerves right now.
- I got shit on my mind.
Ooh!
You know, I ain't six.
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?
KIM and ZO:
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.
What the fuck are you guys doing?
Page 46/51
What does that mean?
Whoa!
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!
That fast enough for your bony ass?
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa ho ho ho!
Oh!
Abernathy, get your ass up here.
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!
Alrighty.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Go, go! Go!
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?
Whoo-hoo!
Yah hoo hoo!
Yah hoo hoo!
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.
Damn it!
Now.
Did you do something to him?
Say something?
Nothing! Shit.
Here he comes, Zo.
He's coming!
Aah!
Shit, oh shit!
No!
Hold on, Zo!
Oh, my God. Zo!
- Oh! Hold on!
- I can't!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Zo! Zo!
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch!
- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on!
Whoa, whoa, get away!
Oh, shit.
I can't see. I can't see!
Zo, move your leg!
Oh! Come on, come on!
Redneck lunatic bastard!
Get away from me!
Page 47/51
fucking legs!
Oh, my God.
Shit, I'm scared, Kim.
I'm really scared.
I know, baby, just hold on.
Watch your feet!
You wanna get hot?
- Fucking son of a bitch!
- You wanna get hot?
Then suck on this for a while, bitch!
Zo! Goddamn it!
Oh, my God. Get away from us,
you cocksucker!
Leave us alone!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you!
Zo! Zo! Oh, Zo!
Hold on!
Zo! Zo!
Look out!
Get ready to fly, bitch.
- Zo!
- Zo, hold on!
He's right on your fucking ass!
Hey! Whoo-hoo!
Hey, ladies, that was fun.
Well, adios.
Ow! Fuck!
Shit! Fuck!
Run away with your ass!
You better run, motherfucker!
That bitch!
I'm okay!
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!
Oh, you fuckin' bitch!
Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?
Zo, the fucking cat!
Whew. That was a close one.
So, where's the maniac?
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.
You wanna go get him?
Oh, hell yeah!
Page 48/51
Honey...
I think you might want to get out.
Fuck that shit.
Let's kill this bastard.
Okay, get your ass in the back.
Let's go.
Where the fuck you going?
I'll be back!
This'll smart. Sweet. Let's go.
Oh, fuck yeah, bitch.
Come on. Bring that shit.
Giddy-up, then!
Yeah!
God!
Come on! Come on.
Why? Oh, no!
Ah! Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
Oh, no!
No, no, no!
No, God!
All right, get it together, man.
What did you...

Take him down!
Now where do you think you 're going?
Fuckin' fuck you!
Where do you think
you 're fucking going?
What the fuck do you think...
Come here!
Go!
Whoo-hoo!
What's wrong with your ass,
motherfucking cocksucker?
Oh, you 're gonna wiggle your ass at me,
gonna wiggle it at me?
Oh, don't like it up the ass, do you,
you redneck lunatic bastard?
Aah!
Oh, yeah, gonna bust a nut
up in this bitch right now!
Oh, I'm the horniest motherfucker
Page 49/51
on the road!
Boo-yah, bitch!
Did you just hit a boat?
Yeah, come on, Kim, get him!
Get that motherfucker!
Forget about the cows, motherfucker!
Move, motherfucker, move!
Motherfucker!
I'm 'bout to bust a nut up
in this bitch...
Watch it, watch it.
Aah!

Oh, you know I can't let you go...
without tapping that ass.
Oh, fuck me!

Boo-yah!

Who's laughing now, bitch!
Shit.
Come on!
Here's Cha Cha!
You've been such a lunatic bastard!
I'm sorry!
What?
I didn't mean anything.
I was just playing around.
Oh, he was just playing around!
- Just playing!
- Well, I ain't playing with you!
Whoa!
Oh, look out, look out, look out.
What's your sign?
Page 50/51
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit.
Don't run, don't run,

Please don't dead-end.
Oh, there the motherfucker is.
Go, go, go!
Get him, get him, get him!

Chapter One
Last Stage to Red Rock
Got room for one more?
Who the hell are you,
and what happened to them?
Names Major Marquis Warren former U.S.
Calvary.
Currentrly I'm a
servant of the court.
Tryin' to bringin' a coupla'
no-goods into market.
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket.
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?
I figure that's where you headed, right?
That damblasted blizzards
been on our ass for the last three hours.
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the
way to Red Rock 'fore it catches us.
So ya' hightailin' it
halfway to Minnie's Haberdashery?
You know I am.
- May I come aboard?
- Well smoke...
it up to me, yes.
- But it ain't up to me.
- Who's it up to?
Fella in the wagon.
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company?
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private
trip. And i'm here to tell ya'...
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.
So if you wanna' go to Minnie's with us...
- you gotta' talk to him.
- Well...
that's what i'll do.
Hold it black fella'!
'fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours and
lay 'em on that rock over yonder.
Then you raise both
your hands way above your hat.
Then you approach....
molasses-like.
Page 2/62
Real trustin' fella', huh?
Not so much.
Put 'em down.
Come on ahead.
I said way above your hat, god dammit.
Now come forward.
That's far enough.
I'll be dogged,
you black fella' i know.
Col. Something Warren, right?
Major Marquis Warren.
I know you too.
We shared a steak dinner
once upon a time in Chattanooga.
You John Ruth, The Hangman.
That be me.
- How longs that been?
- Since that steak?
Eight months.
So why don't you explain to me...
what an african bounty
hunter's doin' wanderin'
around in the snow in
the middle of Wyoming.
I'm tryin' to get a coupla'
of bounty's to Red Rock.
So you still in business?
You know I am.
What happened to your horse?
Circumstances caused us to take the long
way around. My horse couldn't make it.
You don't know nothin'
about this filly here?
Nope.
Don't even know your name?
Nope.
Well I guess that makes
this one fortuitous wagon.
I sure as hell hope so.
Major Marquis Warren,
this here is Daisy Domergue.
Domergue, to you, this is Maj.
Warren.
Howdy nigger!
Page 3/62
She's a pepper, ain't she?
Now girl, don't you know
darkee's don't like bein'
called niggers no more.
They find it offensive.
- I been called worse.
- Now that I can believe.
- Heard of her?
- Should I?
Well she ain't no John Wilkes Booth, but...
maybe you might of heard
tell 'bout the price on her head.
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.
Damn, what she do?
Kill Lily Langtree?
Not quite.
Now that ten thousand's
practically in my pocket.
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides.
Especially to professionals
open for business.
Well I certainly can appreciate that.
I ain't got no designs on her.
One of my fella's over
there is worth four
thousand, one's worth
three, and one's worth one.
That's damn sure good enough for me.
Well...
Let me see their paperwork.
Like I said, molasses-like.
Back off.
Look...
I sure hate to interrupt y'all!
But we gtta' cold damn blizzard,
hot on our asses we tryin'
to beat to shelter!
I realize that!
Now shut your mouth
and hold them damn horses while I think!
Okay boy, we'll give it a try.
But you leave those pistols
Page 4/62
over yonder with the driver.
You ain't really gonna'
let that nigger ridin' in
here is ya'? I mean maybe
up there with O.B., but-
How you like the sound
of them bells, bitch?
They are real pretty, ain't they?
You open up your trashy
mouth again, I'll knock
out them front teeth for ya'.
You got it?
Yeah.
Let me hear you say: "I got it."
I got it.
Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin'
these fella's up on the roof.
Give O.B. fifty dollars when
ya' get to Red Rock, and he'll help ya'.
Well, I agree with O.B.
This storm's got me concerned.
We get goin' a lot
quicker you help out too.
Goddamit to hell, I'm
already regretting this!
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's
to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.
And my wrist is gonna'
stay cuffed to hers, and
she ain't never gonna'
leave my goddamn side,
until I personally put her in the
Red Rock jail! Now do you got that?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

So what happend to your horse?
He got old.
I done had him for a bit.
When the weather took a
turn for the worse, he
done what he could, but
he couldn't make it.
- That's too bad.
Page 5/62
- Yes it is.
Me an' ole Lash rode a
lotta' miles together.
You could say he was
my best friend- if I
considered stupid animals
firends, which I don't.
Never the less....
I'm gonna' miss 'em.
Who's Daisy Domergue?
A no damn good murdering
bitch, that's who.
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions
'bout bringing a woman to a rope.
- If by woman, you mean her?
No I do not have mixed emotions.
So you takin' her into Red Rock to hang?
- You bet.
- Gonna' wait to watch it?
You know I am.
I wanna' hear her neck
snap with my own two ears.
You never wait to watch 'em hang?
My bounties never hang,
cause I never bring 'em in alive.
Never?
Never ever.
We talked about this in Chattanooga.
Bringing desperate men in alive,
is a good way to get yourself dead.
Can't catch me sleepin'
if I don't close my eyes.
I don't wanna' work that hard.
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.
No one said
it was suppose to be that hard, nether.
But that little lady,
is why they call him "The Hangman".
When the handbill says
Dead or Alive, the rest of
us shoot ya' in the back
from up on top of a perch
somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle.
Page 6/62
But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya',
you don't die by a bullet in the back.
When The Hangman catches you...
you hang.
You overrate 'em nigger.
I'll give you he got guts.
But in the brains department,
he like a man who took a
high dive in a low well.
Now Daisy,
I want us to work out a
signal system of communication.
When I elbow you real hard in the face...
that means:
You got it?
I got it.
I...
I know we only met each other once before.
And I don't mean to unduly
imply intimacy. But...
Well...
You still got it?
I still got, what?
The Lincoln letter?
Of course.
Do you got it on you?
Where?
Right here.
Look, I know you gotta'
be real careful with it and all.
I can imagine you probably
don't like to take
it in an'out of the
envelope all that often.
But if you wouldn't mind,
i'd sure appreciate seein' that again.
You right,
I don't like taking it in an'out
of the envelope that much.
- Yeah.
- But...
as your saving my life an' all,
I suppose I could let you read it again.
Page 7/62
"Ole Mary Todd's callin',
so I guess it must be time for bed"
Ole Mary Todd.
That gets me.
That gets me too.
You know what this is, tramp?
It's a letter from Lincoln.
It's a letter from Lincoln to him.
They shared a correspondence
during the war.
They was pen pals.
This is just one of the letters.
What the...
O.B.
Stop!
Whoa, easy.
Of all the stupid,
like to rip my goddamn arm off!
I didn't,
drag her stikin' ass up
this goddamn mountain, just
for you to break her neck
on the ouskirts of town.
You the one handed her my goddamn letter.
I didn't give it to her,
I gave it to you!
That nigger like to bust my jaw.
You ruin that letter of his,
that niggers gonna' stomp your
ass to death. And when he do,
I'm gonna sit back on that
wagon wheel watch and laugh.
How is it?
She didn't help it none.
But it's alright.
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?
You... ain't no goddamn... lady!
Hey Mister Ruth?
What?
There's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!
What?
I said, there's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!
Page 8/62
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,
whole lotta' fellas walkin' around,
wouldn't you say, Major?
Considerin I'm one half
of them fellas, yeah...
seems to be a lot of 'em.
This changes things, son.
Eight thousand dollars a
lotta' money for a nigger.
But with a partner,
eighteen's a whole lot better.
You really think I'm
in cahoots wit' that fella'? Or her?
- Put them on.
- I ain't wearin' handcuffs.
You put those on or you can stop worryin'
about this whole thing, right now.
Chapter Two Son of a Gun
Hand your weapons to the driver.
Little jumpy, ain't you?
Never mind the jokes, just do it.
- If you say so.
- I do.
Okay...
I done did it.
O.B.?
Ya' got 'em?
- I got 'em!
- Okay fella',
you keep holdin'
that lantern in that one hand,
and you keep that other
hand where I can see it.
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at cha'.
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.
Is that you Chris Mannix?
- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?
- Not quite.
- You know this fella'?
- Only by reputation.
Like I said friend,
you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.
Keepin' you at a disadvantage,
Page 9/62
is a advantage I intend to keep.
Whoever you are mister,
you sure sound tough when you're talkin'
to a desperate man knee deep in snow.
I don't want no trouble.
I just wanna' ride.
I'm freezin to death.
Who is this joker.
You heard of the rebel
renegade Erskine Mannix?
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.
The scourge of South
Carolina, Mannix Marauders.
That's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.
What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?
Well Mr. Face,
I was riding to Red Rock and my horse
stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,
fucked up his leg,
an' had to put 'er down.
You got business in Red Rock?
- Yes I do.
- What?
I'm the new sheriff.
- Horseshit.
- 'fraid not.
- Where is your star?
- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.
Once I get there they swear me in,
but that ain't happened yet.
And that's when
you get your star.
You got anything that
can back any of this up?
Yeah.
When we get to Red Rock.
And from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,
I figure you're a bounty hunter
open for business.
And I figure you're taking them three
dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?
Three dead.
Page 10/62
One alive.
- Who's that?
- Daisy Domergue.
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.
The Hangman?
Well I'll be double dogged damned.
- You're The Hangman, Bob Ruth.
- It's John.
And you...
your're the nigger with the head...
Major Marquis.
My lord, is that really the real head
of Major Marquis, lookin' at me now?
Yeah it's really me and
it's really my head.
What's goin' on, y'all havin'
a bounty hunters picnic?
Never mind, you takin' in
them three dead bodies
and her to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't ya'?
Yeah.
Well...
the man is red Rock suppose
to pay you is me. The new sherrif.
So if you wanna get paid,
you need to get me to Red Rock.
Well execuse me for findin'
it hard to belive a
town electin' you to do
anything except drop dead.
So I'm suppose to freeze death,
'cause you find something hard to belive?
No I suppose not.
Put them on and come inside.
No.
- Then you'll freeze.
- Then you'll hang.
How so?
Driver!
Could you come down here and join us?
I gotta hold these horses
Page 11/62
I can hear you just fine from up here.
You heard me tell this fella'
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?
Yeah.
Red Rock is my town.
And I'm gonna' enter my town
in bounty hunters chains? No Sir!
Sorry bushwackers,
I ain't entering Red Rock that way.
When you finally get to
Red Rock, you're going
to realize every goddamn
thing I said was right.
And I expect you, O.B.,
to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock that John
Ruth, let their new
sheriff freeze to death.
There ain't no bounty
on my head, bushwacker.
You let me die, that's murder.
Hold out your hands.
O.B.
Give the Major back his iron.
One thing I know for sure,
this nigger-hatin'
son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.
Now...
I'll help protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten,
deal?
Ain't love grand. Y'all wanna' lie on
the ground and make snow angels together?
- Tell ya' what, Bob-
- The name's John.
When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you and
Major Marquis there dinner and booze.
- May way of sayin' thanks.
- I don't drink,
with rebel renegades,
and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em.
Well Mr. Ruth,
you sound like you got
a axe to grind against The Cause.
Page 12/62
The cause of a renegade army?
A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the
Rebel Flag as an excuse to kill and steal.
And this should interest you Warren,
imparticular emancipated blacks.
Sounds like my kinda' fella'.
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta'
newspapers printed in Washington D.C.
Anywho, I'm just tryin'
to let y'all know grateful I am.
I was a goner, and
y'all saved me.
You wanna' show me how
grateful you are...
shut up!
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.
Here, last piece.
Does he know how famous you once was?
I don't think so.
Black eye.
Do you know who he is?
Do I know about the thirty
thousand dollar reward
the Confederacy put on the
head of Major Marquis?
Yeah.
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,
but they never did
get 'em the right nigger head, did they?
No they didn't.
But it wasn't for lack of tryin'.
Them peckawoods left their homes and their
families, and come to this snowy mountain,
lookin' for me and fortune.
None of them found fortune.
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,
they found me.
Now it didn't stay 30
thousand the length of the war.
Once passions had colled,
it dropped down to eight, then five.
But, I bet even
when it was five thousand,
Page 13/62
you had your share
of country boys comin' to call?
You know I did.
Why did they have a reward on you?
The Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing them.
After I broke out of Wellenbeck,
The South took my continued
existence as a personal affront.
So The Cause put a reward on my head.
What's...
Wellenbeck?
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?
No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!
You bust out?
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out.
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea.
So bright...
you got to wonder,
why nobody never thought about it before.
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.
Well the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling.
So I burnt it down.
There was a rookie regiment
spendin' the overnight in that camp.
Forty-seven men...
burnt to a crisp.
Southern youth, farmer's sons,
- cream of the crop-
- And I say, "Let 'em burn".
I'm suppose to apologize
for killin' Johnny Reb?
You joined the war to
keep niggers in chains.
I joined the war to
kill White Southern
Crackers And that means
kill 'em anyway I can.
Shoot 'em. Stab 'em.
Drown 'em. Burn 'em.
Drop a big ole' rock on their head.
Whatever it took to put
Page 14/62
White Southern Crackers in the ground
that's what I joined the war to do,
and that's what I did.
To answer your question, John Ruth,
when Major Marquis
burned forty seven men alive,
for no more a reason then to give
a nigger a run for the trees,
that's when The South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.
And I made them trees, Mannix.
And you best belive I ain't look back
till I crossed The Northern Line.
But you had a surprise waitin' for you
on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?
See once they started pullin' out
all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,
seems not all of them boys were Rebs.
You burnt up some of your own boys,
didn't ya' Major?
How many burnt prisoners
they end up findin'?
Wasn't the final Yankee death count
somethin' like thirty-seven?
That's the thing about war Mannix,
people die.
So ya' chalkin' it up to "War Is Hell", ha?
Well admittedly that's a hard argument
to argue with. But if memory serves,
your side didn't look at it that way.
I think they thought,
thirty-seven white men for one nigger
wasn't so hot a trade.
I belive they accused you
of being a kill crazy nigger who
only joined the war to kill white folks
and the whole Blue and Grey
of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.
And that's why they drummed
your black ass outta'
the Cavalry with a yellow
stripe down your back.
Isn't it Major?
Horse shit.
Page 15/62
If he did all that, the
Cavalry woulda' shot him.
I didn't say they could prove it.
But they sure did think it out loud,
didn't they Major?
But,
Warren's war record was stellar,
and that's what saved his ass.
Are you killed
yourself your share of
redskins in your day,
didn't ya' Black Major?
Cavalry tends to
look kindly on that.
I'll tell a' what The Cavalry
didn't look kindly on.
Mannix's Marauders that's what.
And the fact that Erskine
Mannix's little boy
would talk about anybody
else's behavior
during war time makes
me wanna horse laugh.
Don't you say anything about my daddy,
what he fought for,
was dignity in defeat,
and against the unconditional surrender.
We weren't foreign barbatians
pounding on the city walls.
We were your brothers.
- We deserved dignity in defeat.
- Just,
how many nigger towns did y'all sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat?
My faire share, Black Major.
'Cuz when niggers are scared,
that's when white folks are safe.
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,
you ride up top wtih O.B.
No no no,
you got me talkin' politics
I didn't wanna'.
Like I said y'all,
Page 16/62
I'm just happy to be alive.
I...
I think I'll just look out this winda'
let this beatuiful
carriage rock me to sleep.
And dream about how lucky I am.
Chapter Three
Minnie's Haberdashery
Get in there.
Easy.
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?
I can see
you already got another one up in here.
I just got through putting the horses away.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.
Who are you?
I'm Bob.
Well whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.
Come on let's go!
- Open up!
- Kick it open!
- What?
- Kick it open!
Shut that door,
there's a goddamn blizzard out there!
- You gotta' nail it shut!
- You have to nail it shut!
Page 17/62
- Hold it shut!
- There's a hammer and nails by the door!
You have to nail it shut!
There's a hammer and nails by the door!
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.
You need to do two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!
- Two pieces of wood.
- That fuckin' thing is busted!
Not just one piece of wood.
- Gimme that other piece of wood.
- Yeah, allright.
- Gimme the nail.
- Here.
Jesus.
That door's a son of a gun.
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella'?
Good heavens,
a woman
out in this white hell.
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.
When did you fella's arrive?
About forty minutes ago.
The Cowboy fella' in the
courner, is that your driver?
No he's a passenger.
The driver lit out. He
said he was going to
spend the blizzard shacked
up with a friend.
Jesus Christ, that's awful!
Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella'
do, soak his ole socks in the pot?
I think we all felt the same way, but were
a little too polite to say something.
- He don't have that problem.
. Where's the well water?
Over there.
So,
all three of you fellas' headed to Red
Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?
Page 18/62
Yes, all three of us
were on that stagecouch out there.
Coffybeans?
Over there.
Get your hand outta' there.
The new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with us.
Sheriff of Red Rock,
that'll be the day.
If he is a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.
Good.
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.
So...
the new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with you?
No he's lyin'
he ain't sheriff of nothin'
He's a southern renegade. He's just talkin'
his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.
What the fuck I tell you
about talkin', huh?
I'll bust you in the mouth right in
front of these people, I don't give a fuck!
You never gave your name, sir.
John Ruth.
- Are you a lawman?
- I'm takin' her to the law.
- You're a bounty hunter?
- That's right, Buster.
- Do you have a warrant?
- 'Course I do.
May I see it?
Why?
You're suppose to produce it upon request.
How am I suppose to know,
you're not a villain,
kidnapping this woman
without a warrant in your possession?
What's your name, Buster?
Well...
it certainly isn't Buster.
It's Oswaldo Mobray.
Page 19/62
- Oswaldo?
- Yes.
Well...
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.
- I take it you're Daisy Domergue?
- Yeah it's her.
- It says here, Dead or Alive?
- Yeah it does.
Transporting a desperate
hostile prisoner such as her
sounds like hard work.
Wouldn't transporting her be easier
if she were dead?
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.
And why is her hanging proper,
so important to you?
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the
hangman. He's gotta' make a living too.
Well I appreciate that.
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
The Hangman in these parts.
- Looks like I brought you a customer.
- So it would appear.
Have you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers?
No I can't say I have.
Don't talk to my prisoner. I talk to
my prisoner, that's it. You got it?
I got I got. Jolly good.
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?
The Bar is open, follow moi.
All right.
All right.
Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!
I'll feed and water the horses.
You go inside and get some hot coffy.
I've got some stew cooking.
Should be done soon.
Now look...
now matter how bad this blizzard gets,
we still gotta' feed these horses
Page 20/62
and take a squat from time to time.
So me an' Chris better lay out a line
from the stable to the front door,
and from the front door to the shithouse.
Okay?
Good idea.
Come on, Chris.
I'll give you a hand.
No no no, go inside, get warm.
You're doing stable work in a goddamn
blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?
You're right, mi amigo.
Muchas gracias.
All right, follow me.
We gonna' drop one,
every ten paces.
- From here to the door.
- Yeah! - All right.
Now, you're wanted for murder.
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.
John Ruth wants to take you back to
Red Rock to stand trail for murder.
And, if...
you're found guilty,
the people of Red Rock will hang you in the
town square. And as the hangman,
I will perform the execution.
And if all those things
end up taking place,
that's what civilized
society calls "justice".
However,
if the relatives and the
loved ones of the person
you murdered were outside
that door right now.
And after busting down that
door, they drug you out
in the snow and hung you
up by the neck, that,
we would be frontier justice.
Now the good part
about frontier justice is
Page 21/62
it's very thirst quenching.
The bad part is
it's apt to be Wrong as Right.
Not in your case. In
your case, you'd have it
comin'. But other people,
maybe not so much.
But ultimately what's the
real difference between the two?
The real difference is Me...
The Hangman.
To me, it dosen't matter what you did.
When I hang you, I
will get no satisfaction from your death.
It's my job.
I hang you in red Rock, I move on to the
next town, I hang someone else there.
The man who pulls the lever,
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man.
And that dispassion is
the very essence of
justice. For justice delivered
without dispassion,
is always in danger of not being justice.
Amen.
No offense cowboy fella',
just gettin' your attention.
Yeah, well...
you got it.
What'cha writing firend?
- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.
- What's that?
My life story.
- You're writing your life story?
- You bet I am.
Am I in it?
You just entered.
Well you like writing
stories so much, why don't
you tell me the story
that brings you here?
- Who's askin'?
- I am.
Page 22/62
John Ruth. I'm bringin' in
this one to Red Rock to hang.
Ain't no way I'm spendin'
a coupla' nights under a
roof with somebody I don't
know who you they are.
And I don't know who you are.
So...
who are you?
- Joe Gage.
- What?
That's my name, Joe Gage.
Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?
- I ain't goin' to Red Rock.
- Where you goin'?
- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.
- What's there?
My mother.
Your mother?
Listen,
I'm just a cow puncher I just...
I got back from a long drive and...
I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,
I was a partner.
For the first time in my life I,
made a pretty penny and, eh....
Come home and spend time with
my mother for Christmas.
Now that's funny.
'Cuz you don't look like the
coming home for Christmas type.
Yeah, well...
you know, looks
can be deceiving.
Because I definitely am a...
coming home for Christmas to
spend time with mother type.
Christmas with Mother?
I mean...
it's a wonderful thing.
Now is that... good
enough for you?
John Ruth?
For now.
Page 23/62
Just steer clear of my prisoner.
Hello old timer.
General.
General.
You sir,
are a Hyena.
And I have no wish to speak to you.
I've been called worse.
Fair enough, General.
Sorry to bother you.
- You gonna' kick it open.
- Kick it open.
It's already cold enough in here.
It dosen't have latch you
gonna' hammer up a board.
You gotta' nail it shut!
- The hammer and nails is by the door.
- There is a hammer and nails right there!
Oh god,
- Holdin' this Chris.
- Here, here.
You need to nail it in!
You need two pieces of wood.
You gotta' hammer another one.
One ain't good enough!
It's gonna' blow right open.
- Goddamn it!
- It's gotta' open if you don't.
- Shut up!
- I got it! Son of a bitch!
Jesis Christ,
that door's a whore!
I get it, haberdashery,
that was a joke.
How's the coffy?
Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.
Thank you.
Guess who he is?
Buffalo Bill?
Hardly, no.
- I'm Oswaldo Mobray, I'm The-
- He's the hangman of Red Rock.
- Oh, you are?
- Yes I am.
Page 24/62
Well good to meet you Mr.?
- Mobray.
- Mobray, I'm Chris Mannix,
- the new sheriff in Red Rock.
- Really?
Horseshit!
- Pay no attention to him.
- Horseshit!
Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot
by the stove is a hell of driver named O.B.
That's the only thing you
said that's the truth.
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?
Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?
- In my beg.
- May I see 'em?
- Of course.
Who's Lance Lawson?
He's a fell' been sittin' in the
Red Rock jail about a month now.
He's the fella - who shot the fella' -
who was sheriff 'fore me.
Precisely.
What did she mean when she said,
bounty hunter's nigger
friend in the stable?
He's got a nigger
bounty hunter firend in the stable.
But all that
just to guard her?
I don't think that was
the original idea, but...
that's the idea now.
- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?
- Yeah.
Five of you?
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.
Yes it does.
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?
Page 25/62
The Lincoln what?
The letter from Abraham Lincoln?
President Abraham Lincoln?
- Weren't you pen pals?
- With the President?
I'm sorry, I heard somebody
in your party had a
letter from Abraham Lincoln,
I assumed it was you.
Not him!
The black fella' in the stable.
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Yeah.
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Say your name was again?
- Bob.
- Warren.
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?
Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her
mother on the north side of the mountain.
- What?
- Yeah.
- They ain't here?
- Yes, they're visiting her mother.
- Her mother?
- Yes.
I never knew Minnie had a mother.
Everybody's got a mother.
Yeah, I suppose.
- And she left you in charge?
- Si.
That sure don't sound like Minnie.
Are you callin' me a liar?
Not yet, I ain't.
- But it sounds peculiar, though,
- What sound peculiar?
Well first of, Minnie never struck me
as the sentimental type.
Secondly,
I can't imagine Sweet
Dave liftin' his fat ass
outta' his chair long
Page 26/62
enough to fetch well water,
unless Minnie was
layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.
Along takin' trips to the north side.
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling
me a liar, mi negro amigo.
Yeah it do sound a whole
lot like, don't it?
But I still haven't done it yet.
Minnie still serve food?
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes. - Then we serve food.
She still stinkin' up the place
with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.
She rolls her own.
"Red Apple Tobacco"
But mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.
Yeah I do, Senor Bob.
Just seein' if you do.
- Fill me up, O.B.
- Yeah.
Goddamn it!
Thank you.
Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty...
is that Genaral Sanford Smithers I see?
You've got a good eye son.
Well, I'll be double dogged damned!
General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!
Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.
- Erskine's boy?
- Yes sir.
May I sit down, Sir?
According to the Yankees,
it's a free country.
Genaral Sandy Smithers...
boy...
oh boy.
Did my daddy talk about you.
I heard you gave those
Blue Bellies sweet hell.
Me and my boys did our part.
Just like Erskine and
Page 27/62
his boys did their part.
Hell yeah, we did.
- Yankees sons of bitches?
- I never knew your father, son.
But, I always respected his resolve.
Thank you for saying that, General. Your
respect woulda' meant the world to him.
Can I get ya' some coffy?
- That would be nice.
- Well, how about a blanked?
That would be even nicer.
Hell, you know what,
you can have mine.
Here we go General.
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?
If ya' don't mind me askin'?
My boy.
You gotta' boy that lives in Red Rock?
My son, Chester
Charles Smithers,
he died out here a few years back.
Forgive me sir.
No forgiveness needed, son.
Like I said, it was a few years back.
It was after he served his service.
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,
to make his fortune.
Never to be heard from again.
I bought him a symbolic plot
in the Red Rock cemetery.
I'm here to advise the stone maker
on his headstone.
Was he a goner fer' sure?
No chance he could be livin'
"the cold life" out in
the woods? It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.
If he had done what he came here to do,
he'd a come home.
Close it, close it!
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut!
Really? Who's the idiot
who broke the damn door?
Page 28/62
Fucking hold it low.
Okay.
Hold it, mi negro amigo.
We need two pieces of wood.
Ola mi cabron.
There you go, motherfucker!
- That's a lotta' hats, Senor Bob?
- Huh?
Considering Minnie's no
hats indoors policy? Which,
If I remember it correctly,
that was one of them Bar of Iron rules,
kinda rule,
she'd want kept up in her absence.
You seem to have a laissez faire
attitude when it comes to the hats.
I'm guilty.
I have a laissez faire
attitude about the hats.
How about we forget
about the hats today,
considering there's a
blizzard going on and all,
and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?
A large black dog.
Labrador.
You know my daddy,
I said that my daddy!
Always said that Davis
was a courages man.
But he should have put capital
in Montgomery and not Richmond.
Yes, Sir. I agree with that the army in
North Virginia would've been used in a...
I said the army of North Virginia would
have been used in very different way.
Shut up!
O.B.?
Do you know that nigger, Sir?
I don't know that nigger.
But I know he's a nigger.
And that's all I need to know.
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.
- That nigger is-
Page 29/62
- General Sanford Smithers?
Battle of Baton Rouge?
Inform the nigger in the
Cavalry officers uniform
that I had a division
of Confederates under my commend,
in Baton Rouge.
Major Nigger, General Smithers wishes me to
inform you... I heard 'em hillbilly.
Inform this old cracker that
I was in Baton Rouge also.
On the other side.
Oh that's interesting.
General Smithers,
he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.
- On the other-
- Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger,
that I don't acknowledge
niggers in Northern uniforms.
You captured a whole
Colored Command that day.
But not one Colored Trooper
made it to a camp, did they?
We had neither the time or the food.
Nor the inclination
to care for Northern horses,
and least of all Northern niggers.
- So we shot 'em where they stood.
- Gentlemen,
Gentlemen,
I know Americans aren't apt
to let a little thing like an unconditional
surrender get in the way of a good war.
But I strongly suggest we don't restage
The Battle of Baton Rouge,
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.
Now, my Nubian friend,
while I realize passions are high,
that was a while ago.
And if you shoot this
un-armed old man I guarantee
I will hang you by the
neck until you are dead.
Page 30/62
Once we arrive in Red Rock.
I damn will guarantee that too.
Yeah Warren,
that's the problem with old men.
You can kick 'em down
the stairs and say it's
a accident, but ya'
can't just shoot 'em.
Gentlemen, since we
may be trapped here,
close together like for a few days,
may I suggest a possible solution?
We divide Minnie's in half.
The Northern side
and The Southern Side.
With the dinner table
operating as a neutral territory.
We could say that the
fireplace side of the room,
acts as a symbolic representative of...
Georgia
While the bar, represents...
Philadelphia!
As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?
I help you protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten?
One of them fella's
is not what he says he is.
What is he?
He's in cahoots with this one
that's what he is.
One of them, maybe even two of 'em,
is here to see Domergue goes free.
And to accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everbody in here.
And they got 'em coupla' days.
So all they gotta' do
is sit tight and wait for
a winda' of opportunity.
And that's when they strike,
huh bitch?
If you say so, John.
Page 31/62
Are you sure you're not
just being paranoid?
Our best bet is this,
duplicitous fella' ain't
as cool a customer as Daisy here.
He won't have the leather patience
it takes to just sit here and wait.
But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing
it's the right one, isn't so easy.
If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.
He'll try and create his opportunity.
And that's when Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.
And what do you got to say about all this?
What do I got to say?
About John Ruth's ravings?
He's absolutely right.
Me and one of them fella's
is in cahoots. And
we're just waitin' for
everybody go to sleep.
That's when we gonna' kill y'all.
Okay everybody,
hear this.
This here is Daisy Domergue.
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.
Ten thousand dollars.
That money's mine boys.
Don't wanna' share it.
I ain't gonna' lose it.
When the sun comes out, I'm taking
this woman into Red Rock, to hang.
Now...
is there anybody here...
comitted to stopping me`...
from doing that?
Really?
Nobody gotta' problem with this?
Well, I guess that's
very fortunate for me.
However, I hope you
all understand,
I can't just take your word.
Circumstances force
me to, take...
Page 32/62
precautions.
When you say precautions...
why do I feel you mean me?
- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.
- You are? - Yes I am.
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?
The Hangman got
himself a gun too?
I'll be dealing with his
gun after I deal with yours.
I feel kinda' naked without it.
Oh, I still got mine.
I'll protect you.
A bastards work is never
done, huh, John Ruth?
That's right, Joe Gage.
- Now gimmie the gun.
- You want it?
You have to come and take-
Calm down.
Take your hand away from your gun.
Blink if you're calm.
- Did he blink?
- He blinked.
Blink if your gonna' remain calm?
- He blinked.
- Take his pistol.
I'm real sorry about this, son.
Like I said, nothing personal.
Just a precaution.
Pretty sneaky.
I'm afraid the same
applies to you too, Mr.
Mobray.
Precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose.
Hand me that little bucket.
O.B.?
Go to the outhouse.
Take this bucket and dump
it down the shit hole.
Why do I gotta' go outside?
Your jacket's already on.
Page 33/62
And I sorta kinda trust you.
After you Major.
Okay.
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.
Don't get any ideas,
I ain't goin' soft on ya'.
You lift your ass even
one inch off this seat,
I'll put a bullet right
in your goddamn throat.
So Domergue,
I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke
of luck as far as you're concerned?
- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?
- No I sure don't.
How 'bout you Oswaldo?
How about me what?
Look,
considerin' all the thing I done
for money, I ain't one to judge.
But don't you feel just the least
little bad 'bout hangin' a woman?
Till they invent a trigger
a woman can't pull, if
you're a hang man, you're
going to hang woman.
Well hell Ozzy, I guess I ain't never
looked at it like that before.
When it comes to some
of them mean bastards
out therem it's the only
thing does the job.
You really only need to hang mean bastards.
But mean bastards, you need to hang.
You goddamn son of a bitch!
I almost died out there!
I ain't never going out in that shit
ever, ever again!
You okay, O.B.?
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.
I just need to get warm.
You want some stew, O.B.?
Stew, later.
Page 34/62
That's nice.
So...
- how you doin', black Major?
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.
Leave me be from your horseshit.
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln Letter?
I tole' you jackass to
Hee-Haw somewhere else.
That's right, John.
- You did say, didn't ya'?
- Yeah I did.
So...
- you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
- Yes.
Thee Abraham Lincoln?
Yes.
Abraham Lincoln The President
of the United States...
- Yes.
- Of America? - Yes.
- Wrote you a letter, personally?
- Yes.
- Personally? As in: "Dear Maj. Warren"?
- No. Personally as in: "Dear Marquis".
"Dear Marquis" Abraham Lincoln the
President of the United States of America?
Yes.
- May I see it?
- No you may not.
But the way John tells it,
you weren't just some
random nigger soldier picked
from a pile of letters.
Way John tells it,
- y'all hada' correspondence.
- Yes.
Way John tells it, y'all's
practically pen pals?
Yes.
And a pen pal's...
practically a friend.
John Ruth,
you really think a nigger
drummed outta' the
Page 35/62
Calvary with a yellow
stripe down his back,
was practically friends with The President
of The United States of America?
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it
to ya' but nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery,
had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,
Least of all, that nigger there.
Was all that horseshit?
Course it was.
Well I guess it's true
what they say about you people.
You can't trust a fuckin' word
that comes outta' your mouth.
What's the matter, John Ruth?
I hurt your feelings?
As a matter of fact, you did.
I know,
I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever
met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.
But you got no idea, what it's like
being a black man facin' down America.
The only time black folks are safe,
is when white folks is disarmed.
And this letter,
had the desired effect of
disarming white folks.
Call it what you want,
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.
You wanna' know why I'd lie
about something like that, white man?
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.
Well I'll tell you like
the lord tole' John,
a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't
have that kinda' effect on me.
- I might let a whore piss on it.
- I spit on it.
Good for you, sister.
Warren goddamit,
you leave that old man alone!
Stand down you son of a bitch,
I shared a battle field with this man.
Or would you deny me that too?
Page 36/62
I suppose you were there.
May I join you?
Yes you may.
Damn it.
So,
how's life since the war?
Got both my legs.
Got both my arms.
- I can't complain.
- Got a woman?
Fever took her, started this last winter.
What was her name?
- Betsy.
- Georgia girl?
Augusta.
Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.
I use to raise Kentucky horses.
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit
where I brought of my ponies.
God damnit.
I made good deal on her.
Took the stake he gave and
bought a bunch peach ochards.
Set myself up pretty well.
Did a hellva' lot better than
my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.
Yeah, your son came up
here a few years back.
He spoke highly of his mama too.
You knew my boy?
Yeah...
Yeah I knew 'em.
You did not know my boy.
Suit yourself.
Didja' know my son?
I know the day he died, - do you?
- No.
You wanna know what day that was?
The day he met me.
He came up here to
do a little nigger head huntin'.
By then the reward was so,
five thousand and bragging rights.
But back then to battle hard rebs, five
Page 37/62
thousand just to cut off a niggers head,
now that's good money.
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain,
lookin' for fortune.
But there was no fortune to be found.
All they found was me.
All them fella's came up
here sang a different tune,
when they found
themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun,
"Let's just forget it.
I go my way, you go yours"
- that's your boy Chester talkin'
- You a goddamn lie.
"If you just let me
home to my family, I'll
swear, I'll never set
foot in Wyoming again."
That's what they all said.
Beggin' for his life.
Your boy told me his whole life story.
And you was in that story, General.
And when I knew me I had the son.
Of The Bloody Nigger
Killer of Baton Rouge...
- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.
- You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!
General Smithers, don't you listen to him,
he didn't know your boy!
He just heard,
tell why you here is all!
It was cold the day I killed your boy.
And I don't mean snwoy mountain in
Wyoming cold. It was colder than that.
And on that cold day,
with your boy at the
business end of my gun barrel...
I made him strip.
Right down to his bare ass.
Then I told him to start walkin'.
I walked his naked ass for two hours,
'fore his cold collapsed him.
- You never even knew my boy?
- No he didn't!
Page 38/62
He's just a sneaky nigger
tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!
Then he commits to begging again.
But this time he wasn't begging to go home.
He knew he'd never see his home again.
And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither.
'Cos he knew that was long gone.
All he wanted... was a blanket.
Now don't judge your boy
too harshly, General. You
ain't never been cold as
your boy was that day.
You'd be surprised what a man that cold,
would do for a blanket.
Wanna know what your boy did?
I took my big, black,
pecker outta' my pants.
And I made him crawl through
the snow on all fours over to it.
Then I grabbed a hand full
of that black hair on the back his head...
Then I stuck my big, black Johnson
right down his goddamn throat.
And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.
And Chester Charles Smithers,
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could.
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?
Your boy...
black dudes dingus in his mouth.
Him shakin', him cryin'
me laughin'
and him not understandin'
But you understand, doncha' Sandy?
I never did give your boy that blanket.
Even after all he did,
and he did everything I asked.
No blanket.
That blanket was just
a heart breakin' liar's promise.
Kinda' like those uniforms
the union issued those colored troopers,
that you chose not to acknowledge.
Page 39/62
So what you gonna' do old man?
You gonna' spend the
next two or three days,
ignore the nigger that killed your boy,
Ignoring how I made him suffer?
Ignoring how I made him...
lick, all over my Johnson?
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...
was to let me know...
he was your boy.
Chapter Four
Domergue's Got a Secret
About fifteen minutes has passed,
since we last left our characters.
Joe Gag volunteered
to take Smithers dead body outside.
Straws we drawn to see
who would help him...
O.B. lost.
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo,
had vigorous debate about the legality of
self-defense murder they just transpired.
Marquis Warren who is
supremely confident about the
legality of what just
transpired, ignored them
sat at a table by himself
and drank brandy.
Captain Chris Mannix dawn
the dead Generals coat and
joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.
Hey Ozzy,
hey you got the right idea.
Let's light this place up.
John Ruth held the door close,
waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.
Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot at the community
dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.
John Ruth...
Yeah?
Can I play that guitar over there?
Page 40/62
Let's go back a bit.
Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.
Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren shot
General Smithers in front of everybody.
But fourty seconds before
that, something equally
as important happened, but
not everybody saw it.
While Major Warren was
captivating the crowd
with tales of black dicks
and white mouths...
somebody... poisoned the coffy.
He did everything I asked, no blanket.
And the only one to see 'em do it...
was Domergue.
That's why this chapter is called...
Domergue's Got a Secret.
John Ruth.
Yeah.
Can I play that guitar over there?
Yeah.
You come back with anything
else but a guitar.
My pistol plays a tune.
Domergues death march, you got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach, huh?
Yeah.
It's kinda' pretty.
- Got another verse to it?
- Yeah I got.
Go ahead, sing it.
Gimme that guitar!
Music time's over!
Turn around.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!
When you get to hell, John.
Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.
Mannix the coffy!
Oh my god!
Page 41/62
Gimme that fucking gun!
Don't test me, bitch.
Everybody get your back sides up
against that back wall over yonder.
Goddamit-
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.
It's up to you.
- I'll get.
- Then get.
You too, Senor Bob.
Everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall.
Move 'em down snowshoes.
Everybody keep your mouth
shut and do like I say.
You open your mouth; you
gonna' get a bullet.
You move a little sudden, a little strange;
you gonna' get a bullet.
Not a warning, not a question;
a bullet.
You got that?
- Let me hear you say, "I got it".
- "I got it".
- "I got it" - "I got it".
- We have it.
Chris Mannix,
come over here on this side.
Come on.
Take this gun out of my holster.
Point it at them.
Like I said, anybody does anything.
And I mean, anything.
Kill 'em.
So...
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth
'bout bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?
I don't know 'bout all that.
But you ain't the killer
who poisoned that coffy.
'cos you almost drunk
it your own damn self.
But one of 'em is.
Gimme the key.
Page 42/62
Gimme the key!
You motherfucking black bastard!
You're gonna' die on this mountain
and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!
What I say 'bout talkin?
'Meant it, didn't I?
And you need to understand,
you just killed the only
man here, comitted to gettin'
you to Red Rock alive.
Now, one of y'all...
is workin' with her.
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.
Or all y'all is...
but only one of you poisoned the coffy.
So what charms this bitch got,
take a man brave a blizzard,
kill in cold blood, I'm
sure I don't know.
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,
so you kill him... okay- maybe.
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.
He damn sure would.
But he sure enough led over there
dead now, though, ain't he?
He damn sure is you
sons of bitches.
Just like any one of us
who'd drank that coffy.
Like me god damnit.
Now those of y'all with
your hands on the wall
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.
Think about how that coulda' you
been you rollin' around on this floor.
And about the men standin' next
ta' ya' would be responsible.
And I know who I got my money on. Yeah
that's right Joe Gage I'm lookin' at you.
Not so fast Chris.
We'll get there.
Let's slow it down.
Let's slow it way down.
Page 43/62
Who made the coffy?
He did.
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
But it's the stew that's got me thinking.
How long you say Minnie been gone?
A week?
Si.
See, my mama used to make stew.
And it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.
And there was another fellow
on the plantation, Uncle Charly.
He made stew too
and like my mama's.
I ate his stew from the
time I was a whipper,
to I was a full grown man.
And no matter the meat,
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.
Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six
months, so I ain't no expert, but that,
damn sure is Minnie's stew.
So if Minnie's on the north side
visiting her mama for a week,
how'd she make the stew this morning?
And this?
This... is Sweet Dave's chair.
When I sat in it earlier,
I couldn't belive it.
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chaire.
This may be Minnie's place,
but this is damn sure,
Sweet Dave's chair.
And if... he went to
the north side....
I'm pretty goddamn sure
that chair's be going with him.
What's in the chair?
Just what I thought.
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.
So...
are you actually accusing me of murder?
The way I see it, Senior Bob,
Page 44/62
whoever's workin' with her,
ain't who they say they is.
And if it's you,
that means Minnie
and her man ain't at her mama's.
They're lyin' out back
there dead somewhere.
Or if it's you Britisch Man,
the real Oswaldo Mobray is lyin'
in a ditch somewhere. And
you're just an English fella'
passin' off his papers.
Or we go by my theory, which
is the ugliest guy did it.
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.
So I take it you've
deduced the coffy was
poisoned while you were
murdering the old man?
Yes.
Well, mi negro amigo,
during that whole incident...
I was sitting on that side of the room.
Playing Silent Night on the piano.
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.
I said you didn't make the stew.
My theory is...
you're working with man
who poisoned the coffy.
And both of y'all murdered Minnie,
and Sweet Dave and whoever
else picked this bad luck
day to visit Minnie's
Haberdashery this morning.
And at some point, y'all intented
to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.
But you didn't count on the blizzard
and you didn't count on the two of us.
That's as far as I got.
How am I doin'?
Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?
So, do you intend to murder me
based on a far fetched nigger theory?
Or can you prove it, cabrone?
Page 45/62
It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.
And it's a little bit more then my theory.
How long you say you been
working for Minnie's?
Four months.
If you would have been here
two and half years ago
you'd know about the sign
usta' hang above the bar.
- Minnie mentioned that to you?
- No.
You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed"
Minnie hung that sign up the
day she opened this Habadashery.
And it hung over that
Bar every day till she
took down, a little
over two years ago.
You know why she took it down?
She started lettin' in dogs.
Now Minnie likes just about everybody,
but she sure don't like Mexicans.
So when you tell me, Minnie went
to North side to visit her mama?
Well I find that highly
unlikely... but okay - maybe.
But when you tell me Minnie
Mink took The Habadashery,
the most precious thing to
her in the whole world,
and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I
said:
Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.
And if you lyin, which you are,
then you killed Minnie -
and Sweet Dave.
Four measly bulltes and
there goes Senior, Bob.
That still don't get us no closer...
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffy, though.
Page 46/62
- Does it Chris?
- No it sure don't.
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy,
to free Daisy.
If I don't hear a
confession from one of you
motherfuckers quick,
fast and in a hurry,
I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy,
down that bitches goddamn throat.
Okay, time's up.
Stop! Alright I did it,
it was me I poisoned the coffy.
I fuckin' knew it!
You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.
Major Warren please let me
sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.
You killed O.B. he's worth ten of you!
Warren can I kill him?
Say adios to your Huevos.
Major Warren?
I ain't got no gun, sheriff.
Chapter Five The Four Passengers
Earlier That Morning.
- Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?
- Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy-
- How many ya' got?
- Full house today, friend.
We got on in there waiting.
Well he's gonna' hafta keep on
waitin' cause we ain't got no room.
Well you need to tell Minnie.
Cause he's been
here two days and Minnie
wants him outta here.
Well I can't give him a seat I don't have -
Listen why don't you take the passengers
inside, introduce them to Minnie.
- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.
- Okay.
Here we are everybody,
Minnie's Haberdashery.
Step outside you and
your friends can stretch
Page 47/62
your legs. When you're
reday, stop on inside,
get warm by the fire, get some coffy
in you. I'll introduve you to Minnie.
Hi Minnie!
I'm not trying to tell
you how to run your business.
But I would think coffy
would be the first thing you'd make.
- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.
- Hats!
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.
Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma.
Lovley smile, that Gemma.
Now the fella' in the
uniform I don't know but
the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.
- Hi ya' Dave.
- Hey Judy.
And Minnie, these are the passengers.
Well that's not good enough.
Go take away them rags,
let's see some faces let's hear some names.
Oswaldo Mobray, madame.
Joe Gage.
Bob.
And I'm Jody.
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm
sanctuary in the middle
of such a cold hell.
Well make yourself comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's
by the stove, if that's all right?
Stove, fireplace, whatever.
Just get warm.
Oh, and Judy said something
about the best coffy in the world?
Yes I do belive Judy did say something
about the best coffy in the world.
Well I don't know 'bout all that.
Page 48/62
But I'll tell ya what it is.
It's hot and it's strong
and it's good. And
in this snow it sure
'nuff warms your ass up.
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need make it.
And you need to get
your ass out there and
help Charly with them
bags and get Ed in here.
- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.
- I'll fix you!
I don't know some old man.
Well I don't know what I'm
suppose to do about it.
I'm just tellin' you what she said.
Anyway she sent me out here
to help Charly, she wants to talk to you.
Got 'em, Ed.
Miss Minnie?
Would you roll me a cigarette?
Sure honey,
I smoke Red Apple Tobacco, that all right?
It's my favorite.
Don't mind me gentlemen,
I'm just watching.
You play?
You know,
I must of had at least twelve people,
teach me that goddamn game.
Just never could keep the moves in my head.
But if I'm not disturbing,
I like to watch?
Hell no. I like whippin' this
old man's ass in front of a audience,
You ain't whippin' shit.
Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle, Minnie.
- Oh that's real nice, what is that?
- It's french.
- You speak french?
- Oui-
- Oui - what is that mean?
- It means yes.
Page 49/62
Oui - Yes.
- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.
- What?
- Ask me if my ass is fat?
- It is.
- I said ask me!
- Why?
- Just do it!
- Is your ass fat?
Oui, look at that y'all
I can speak French.
Are you the jelly bean
salesman around here?
How many peppermint
sticks I get for a nickel?
Five.
All right.
- Here.
- Thank you sugar.
Okay.
Allow me to assist you, madame.
I brought in your bags
in case anybody wants
to change your clothes
before Red Rock.
Peppermint stick?
Thanks.
So why do they call you
Six Horse Judy anyway?
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen
that could drive a six horse team?
Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.
- Could you holding this for me?
- Rock steady, madame. Rock steady.
You gotta' very sweet accent,
where that from, England?
- I take exception to that!
- New Zeeland.
- Carefull, madame.
- Is it anywhere near Old Zealand?
Auckland, what the
fuck is an Auckland?
It's where I'm from,
it's our biggest city.
Page 50/62
- Coffy's ready!
- It's about damn time.
- Best coffy on the mountain.
- I'll don't know 'bout all that.
Stagecoach drivers like it. Passengers,
not so much.
Most find it a
mite too strong.
Can't be too strong on
this mountain, thank you.
Well, what'd ya' think?
Shit!
He adds something,
not much, but something.
What do you think, Pete?
Well I must admit, he does make
the set up more convincing.
Do we collect the bodies
and chuck 'em in the well out there?
And then start unhitching the horses
and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed.
Well hang on, by puttin the
horses away that's easy enough.
To drag these fat bastards up and down the
mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.
Look I just started working here.
Whatever Minnie to make y'all mad.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well old man,
if you was a cat what
just happened here
would count as one of your nine lives.
You realize how close you came to being
tossed on a pile of niggers?
- Yes. And when it comes to that pile
of niggers we building out back,
won't take nothin' to make you
General of it. You believe that?
- I expect no less.
- Not so fast old man.
You might have a way out of this yet.
Later today,
dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.
And he's gonna have my sister with him,
Page 51/62
and he's gonna have her in chains.
He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.
- You know why?
- No.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's why.
And when he get's here.
I'm gonna' kill that fella'
and turn my sister lose.
Now do you have any reason
why you'd want to interfere
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?
- No.
- You don't.
- No I don't.
- You sure you don't.
I mean we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.
You and Sweet Dave
seemed pretty chummy over here.
I just met these people. I don't give a
damn about them, or you, or your sister,
or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming for that matter.
That is a good answer, old man.
So when they get here,
you just sit your ass in this chair.
And you don't do nothin'.
You don't say nothin'. Hello, thank
you, good night, that's about it.
Maybe your name, but that's it.
Hello, thank you, good night and...
- Maybe your name.
- Maybe my name.
Be an old man, be dotty.
Go to sleep.
And don't you say nothin'
and I mean nothin'
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
When it's safe I kill him,
Page 52/62
free my sister and leave you be.
Deal?
Deal, thank you.
During the next four hours, Jody and the
boys chuck the bodies down the well.
Put away the horses.
Tidied around Minnie's.
Stash weapons for further use.
And waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's Stage to arrive.
Here they come.
Okay boys, this is it, get ready!
Let's get ready.
Now remember, it dosen't matter
if we have four men or fory,
we're still gonna' be
facing John Ruth chained
to my sister with a pistol
pointed at her belly.
Now killin' that fella' 'fore he
kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.
But you believe that's
exactly what we're gonna do.
So the name of the game here is patience.
Trapped here for two or three days,
at some point, he will close his eyes
and that's when you
blow the top of his head off.
Remember old man, my sister don't make it
off this mountain alive, neither do you.
I'll do my best.
Good luck, mate.
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?
I can see
you already got another one up in here.
I just got through putting the horses away.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
I can do another one.
And Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Page 53/62
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob.
Well whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.
Come on let's go!
- Open up!
- You have to kick it open! - What?
Kick it open!
Last Chapter
Black Man, White Hell
How you doin' old boy?
They shot my nuts off they're freezin'
burining up the same time,
bleedin like a stuck pig.
I think I'm gonna die.
And these motherfuckers did it.
That's how I'm doin'.
How you doin'?
Well my leg hurts really bad.
But I think if I'm put all
my weight on my right foot-
I'm just bein' sarcastic
I don't give a fuck about your leg.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Don't worry about my comfort.
Shit! I can't feel my ass no more.
Worry about these owl hoots and that
bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement.
All right!
You!
Fella' in the basement!
You either give up by the
time I count to three,
or I shoot Domergue in the head.
Page 54/62
One!... Two!...
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot her!
I'm comin' up!
Hold on there you bushwhacker
sack shooter, you
just open the door we
tell you to come up!
Now throw out your pistol!
Throw it to the bed.
Well he got another.
Now throw out your other pistol.
I ain't got another pistol!
Well you better shit
another pistol out your ass!
Cause if you don't throw one up here in the
next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch!
See? told ya'.
Now...
with your hands where we can see 'em...
slowly come on up!
How ya' doin' dummy?
Better now I see your ugly face.
How you like you that?
You bushwhacker castrator!
What are you doin' he was giving up?
It took him too long so I done for him.
Joe Gage get your
ass over and shut this trap door.
I'm sorry, honey.
May I sit in the chair?
Yes you may.
Keep your hands flat on that table.
And don't move 'em.
Mannix!
You sure picked the wrong time to turn
into a nigger lover.
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?
You're about to be murdered
in some nigger named
Minnie's house and you
don't even know why!
Okay, bitch...
I'll bite... why?
Page 55/62
I am workin with all
three of them fella's...
but not cause they got
butterflies in their belly 'bout me.
But because we're all gang members,
The Jody Domergue Gang!
That fella' y'all just killed in the
basement, was Jody Domergue, my brother!
Well who the hell,
is Jody Domergue?
You wanna tell 'em bounty man?
He's a big bad cat.
He's worth fifty thousand dollars.
And every member of his
gang is wort at least ten.
Wich finally explains why you're worth ten.
And what's gonna' happen
when that sun comes
out nigger, so is my
brother's fifteen men
comin' straight here for us!
Tell 'em Grouch!
Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in Red Rock.
If we couldn't kill John
Ruth and free Daisy here.
Their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth and free Daisy there.
Now with brohter deadd,
I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?
Oh yeah.
And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't
done anything yet, we can't forgive.
So...
- let's make a deal?
- No deals, bitch!
You gonna' let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?
Hold it Warren.
Seein' as she ain't got
nothin' to sell, I'm
kinda curious about her
sales pitch, humor me.
All right, bitch.
What's... your... deal?
Page 56/62
Easy.
Take your gun, shoot
that nigger dead.
Then we sit here all nice like
for the next two days.
When the snow melts...
we go back to Mexico and you go on to Red
Rock to get that star pinned on your chest.
Well... we can give 'em Marco.
Bob's real name is
"Marco The Mexican".
He's worth twelve thousand dollars.
- That's "Marco The Mexican"?
- Precisely, yeah.
Sheeit, after I blew his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.
If I die in the next two days, which
is more than likely, you can have me.
Under the name "English Pete
Hicox" I've gotta' federal
bounty of fifteen thousand
dollars on my head.
- And it's all your Chris.
- You keep talkin', Pete.
You gonna talk yourself to death.
Joe Gage, who you be?
- Grouch Douglass.
- You heard of him?
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.
He's worth ten, just like Daisy.
Remind me,
why we wouldn't just kill
all y'all and cash in?
Oh, you can kill us all. But you'll
never spend a cent of that bounty money
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.
Because when that snow
melts, the rest of Jody's
gang - all fifteen of 'em
- that were waiting,
in Red Rock are comin' here.
Now let, let's say you shoot us all...
If you really want all that
Domergue Gang bounty money,
Page 57/62
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.
And that ain't gonna' be so easy. Cause I
doubt you can drive a four horse team.
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two horse team.
So that means you're gonna' hafta'
lead a string of horses into Red Rock
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,
you ain't gonna' be able to get away with
any more then let's say one body per horse.
So that's you, leading a string of
four horses into Red Rock,
and with all them horses, in that snow,
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.
And you gonna' run smack
dab into The Domergue
Gang and agin Grouch,
how many is that?
- Fifteen killer strong.
- And when those fifteen killers,
come across you,
in possession of all of
our dead bodies, they
ain't just gonna' kill
you and that nigger.
There gonna go back to Red Rock
and kill every son of a bitch in that town.
You really the Sheriff of Red Rock?
You wanna save the town?
Then shoot that nigger dead!
You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!
Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?
The deal still stands, Chris.
You ain't done we can't forgive.
It's still all on that nigger.
Shoot 'em dead, take my body
and sit out the snow with Daisy and Grou-
Mannix!
Give me my pistol!
Catch 'em here.
Catch 'em here.
Page 58/62
So...
you were sayin'...
we sit here...
all nice and friendly like...
for the next two days...
then the snow melts,
you leave here, meet up
with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?
Yeah.
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?
Yeah.
But Jody's worth fifty thousand,
what 'bout his body?
You gonna make a deal with
this diabolical bitch?
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal
with her, we're just talkin'. Calm down.
So what about Jody's body
and the fifty thousand?
You've gotten greedy, Reb, no deal.
We take Jody's body back with us
he got children.
So I kill, Warren...
and we're all friends?
Yeah.
No deal, tramp.
Chris you're makin' the biggest
mistake of your life!
When our boys get here in a coupla' days,
their gonna cut your nuts off!
And there won't be a
stick left in that town unburnt.
Well I guess I should be
plum scared right now, huh?
If you had any brains, you would be.
You see...
here's the problem Daisy.
In order for me to be
scared of your threats,
I got to believe in those fifteen extra
gang members waitin' it out in Red Rock.
And boy, oh boy... I sure don't.
What I belive is...
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass
Page 59/62
whatever the fuck his name was....
poisoned the coffy...
and you watched him do it.
And you watched me pork up
and didn't say shit...
and I believe...
you all what you've always been...
a lyin' bitch,
who will do anything...
to cheat that rope waitin'
for her in Red Rock.
Including shittin' out
fifteen extra gang members,
Whenever you needs be.
And...
I believe when it comes to what's left of
The Jody Doe-ming-grey Gang...
I'm lookin' at 'em,
right here right, right
now. Dead on this on this
motherfuckin' floor.
Goddamn right.
You're gonna' die on
this mountain, Chris.
- My brother leds an army of men-
- Horse Shit!
My daddy led an army, he led a
renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause!
My daddy held up to
four hundred men together after the war
with nothing but
their respect in his command.
Your brother's just a owl hoot
who led a gang of killers.
I don't feel so good.
Oh, shit.
You still alive, white boy?
Mannix?
Fuck!
Hey, boy!
Get up!
Chris Mannix!
Your ass ain't nailed to the floor!
Wake the fuck up!
Page 60/62
Wake up, white boy!
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.
Chris Mannix,
I may have misjudged you.
Now we've come to the part of the story...
- where I blow your goddamn head off!
- No, no, no don't shoot her!
Why the hell not?
John Ruth.
John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.
What's the las thing...
that bastard did, 'fore he died?
Was save your life.
We gonna' die, white boy.
We ain't got no say in that.
But there's one thing left
we do have a say in.
And that how we kill this bitich.
And I say, shootin's to good for her...
John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere,
anytime along the way,
but John Ruth was The Hangman...
and when The Hangman catches ya',
you don't die by no bullet.
When the The Hangman catches ya'...
you hang.
"You only need to hang Mean Bastards."
"But Mean Bastards, you need to hang".
As my first and final act
as the Sheriff of Red Rock,
I sentence you, Domergue,
to hang by the neck until dead.
Hang on, Daisy.
I wanna watch.
Now that, was a nice dance.
That sure was pretty.
Hey...
can I see that Lincoln Letter?
Dear Marquis...
I hope this letter finds you...
in good health and stat...
I'm doing fine...
altough I whish
there were more hours in the day....
Page 61/62
is just so much to do...
time's changing slowly...
but surely...
and it's men like you
that will make a difference...
your military success was a credit...
not only to you... but
your race aswell...
I'm very proud
everytime I hear new of you...
we still have a long way to go,
but hand in hand...
I know we'll get there...
I just want to let you know,
you're in my thoughts...
hopefully our paths will
cross in the future...
until then... I
remain your friend...
ole' Mary Todd's calling...
so I guess it must be time for bed...
respectfully... Abraham Lincoln.
Ole' Mary Todd...
That's a nice touch.
Yeah... Thanks.
Creator:
Happy X-Mas, y'all.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1
By Quentin Tarantino
Page 1/22
Do you find me sadistic?
You know, I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.
If I wanted to.
You know, kiddo.
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,
to know that there's nothing sadistic
in my actions.
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.
But not you.
No, kiddo.
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.
Bill.
It's your baby.
Coming!
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.
What you gonna do now?
What you got?
I got your ass!
Remember that? Remember?
Okay.
Come on, bitch.
Come on.
Bring it on.
Mommy, I'm home.
Hey, baby.
How was school?
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his little ass
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?
Baby, now,
you can't come in here.
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.
This is an old friend of Mommy's
Page 2/22
I ain't seen in a long time.
Hi, honey.
I'm...
What's your name?
Her name is Nikki.
Nikki.
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.
How old are you, Nikki?
Nikki... asked you
a question.
I'm 4.
You know,
I had a little girl once.
She'd be about 4 now.
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk
to talk about.
You go in your room.
I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.
Okay?
Nikkia!
In your room.
Now.
You want some coffee?
Yeah. Sure.
This Pasadena homemaker's name
is Jeanne Bell.
Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.
But back when we were acquainted,
four years ago,
her name was Vernita Green.
Her code name was Copperhead.
Mine, Black Mamba.
Do you have a towel?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You still take cream
and sugar, right?
Yeah.
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology?
Page 3/22
You suppose correctly.
Look, bitch, I need to know
if you're gonna start any more shit
around my baby girl.
You can relax for now.
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?
That's being more rational
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.
Not rationality.
Look.
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.
You have every right
to want to get even.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
To get even, even Stephen,
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,
then wait for your husband,
the good Dr. Bell, to come home,
and kill him.
That would be even, Vernita.
That'd be about square.
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.
But I can't.
All I can tell you is that
I'm a different person now.
Oh, great.
I don't care.
Be that as it may,
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.
Bitch, you can stop right there.
Just because I have no wish
Page 4/22
to murder you
before the eyes of your daughter
does not mean that parading her
in front of me
is gonna inspire sympathy.
You and I have
unfinished business.
And not a goddamn thing
you've done
in the subsequent four years,
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.
So when do we do this?
It all depends.
When do you want to die?
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
How about tonight, bitch?
Splendid.
Where?
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach Little League
about a mile from here.
We meet there around 2.30
in the morning,
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.
And we have us a knife fight.
We won't be bothered.
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw
with an edged weapon.
Fuck you, bitch.
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass,
Black Mamba.
Black Mamba.
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.
Weapon of choice?
If you want to stick with
Page 5/22
your butcher knife, that's fine.
Very funny, bitch.
Very funny!
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.
For that, I'm sorry.
But you can take my word for it.
Your mother had it coming.
When you grow up, if you
still feel raw about it...
I'll be waiting.
For those regarded as warriors...
When engaged in combat...
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.
Come on out to Dallas.
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.
And next, we got some record.
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.
Give me a figure.
Nine dead bodies.
And we're talking
the whole shebang.
Bride. Groom.
Reverend.
Reverend's wife.
They even shot that old coloured fella
that plays the organ.
It would appear to me
somebody objected to this union
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.
Good gravy, Marie.
Page 6/22
What'd I tell you, Pop?
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.
- You're in a house of worship.
- Sorry, Pop.
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.
Four, maybe five strong.
How can you tell?
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.
This is the work of a salty dog.
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,
all the colours are kept
inside the lines.
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.
Who's the bride?
Don't know.
The name
on the marriage certificate
is Arlene Machiavelli.
That's a fake.
We've been calling her "The Bride"
on account of the dress.
You can tell she was pregnant.
Man would have to be a mad dog
to shoot a goddamn good-Iooking gal
like that in the head.
Look at her.
Hay-coloured hair.
Big eyes.
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.
Son Number One?
Page 7/22
Yeah?
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.
I might never have liked you.
Point in fact, I despise you.
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.
Dying in our sleep is a luxury
that our kind
is rarely afforded.
My gift to you.
For fuck's sake.
Hello, Bill.
What's her condition?
Comatose.
Where is she?
I'm standing over her right now.
That's my girl.
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.
What?
We owe her better than that.
Oh, you don't owe her shit!
Will you keep your voice down?
You don't owe her shit!
May I say one thing?
Speak.
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.
But you didn't kill her.
And I put a bullet in her head.
But her heart
just kept on beating.
Now, you saw that yourself
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.
But one thing we won't do
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat
and kill her in her sleep.
Page 8/22
And the reason
we won't do that thing
is because that thing
would lower us.
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?
I guess.
Do you really have to guess?
No.
I don't really have to guess.
I know.
Come on home, honey.
Affirmative.
I love you very much.
I love you, too.
Bye-bye.
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?
Word of advice, shithead.
Don't you ever wake up.
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.
Bill, it's your baby.
Oh, my baby.
Four years.
Four years.
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.
You getting your freak on
or what?
Oh, yeah, boy.
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.
Rule number one.
No punching her.
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner
or less some teeth, jig's up.
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.
By the way,
this cunt's a spitter.
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
Page 9/22
- Yeah.
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites. No hickeys.
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.
After that,
it's all good, buddy.
Her plumbing down there
don't work.
Feel free to come in her
all you want.
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.
I'll be back in 20.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.
Bon apptit, good buddy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God damn.
You are the best-Iooking girl
I've had today.
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.
Coming in, ready or not.
Hey, buddy, did you have yourself
a good time, man?
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill?
Please stop hitting me.
Where's Bill?
I don't know who Bill is!
Bullshit!
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?
Jane Doe? We don't know
shit about you, do we?
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.
My name is Buck,
Page 10/22
and I'm here to fuck.
Your name is Buck.
Right?
And you came here to fuck.
Right?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Pussy Wagon."
You fucker.
Texas. Okay.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...
Wiggle your big toe.
I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.
And the dicks responsible.
Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.
When fortune smiles
on something
as violent and ugly as revenge,
it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,
you're doing his will.
At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,
the first name
on my death list,
O- Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.
But when one
manages the difficult task
of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,
one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?
O- Ren Ishii was born
Page 11/22
on an American military base
in Tokyo, Japan.
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American army brat
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.
It was at that age
she witnessed
the death of her parents
at the hands
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.
Mommy.
She swore revenge.
Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto
was a paedophile.
At 11, she got her revenge.
Look at me, Matsumoto...
...take a good look at my face.
Look at my eyes.
Look at my mouth.
Do I look familiar?
Do I look like somebody...
you murdered?!
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.
At 25, she did her part
in the killing
of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,
in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.
She should have killed 10.
However, before satisfaction
would be mine,
first things first.
Wiggle your big toe.
Hard part's over.
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?
Page 12/22
Okinawa.
One-way.
Hi.
Welcome...
Welcome.
You English?
Almost.
American.
American.
Welcome, American.
Domo.
My English very good.
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?
No, no.
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.
May I sit at the bar?
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.
What other words did you learn?
Oh, just a minute.
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.
I'm watching my soap operas.
Lazy bastard...
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!
The tea's hot.
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?
Shut up!
Get your ass out here!
Excuse me.
What other Japanese do you know?
Oh, let's see.
"Arigato."
"Arigato."
Good!
I already said "domo," right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Konn-itch-iwa."
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."
Konnichi wa.
Please repeat.
Page 13/22
Konnichi wa.
Perfect.
Good, good, good.
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.
Now you're making fun of me!
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.
Pronunciation very good.
You say arigato
like we say arigato.
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.
You should learn Japanese.
Very easy.
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.
Most difficult.
But you have Japanese tongue.
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?!
Hurry up... goddammit!
Lazy oaf...
What d'ya want?
I beg your pardon?
Drink.
Oh, yes.
A bottle of warm sake, please.
Warm sake?
Very good!
One warm sake!
Sake? In the middle of the day?
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!
How come I always have to get the sake?
You listen well...
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.
If this were the military,
I'd be General by now!
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,
and you'd still get the sake -
Page 14/22
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake!
Do you understand?
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.
Do you understand me?
Sorry.
First time in Japan?
What brings you to Okinawa?
I came to see a man.
Oh, yeah.
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?
Not quite.
Not friend?
I never met him.
Never?
Who is he?
May I ask?
Hattori Hanzo.
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?
I need Japanese steel.
Why do you need Japanese steel?
I have vermin to kill.
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.
Huge.
May I?
You may.
Wait.
Try the second one down.
Funny.
You like samurai swords.
I like baseball.
I wanted to show you these.
However...
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...
I no longer make instruments of death.
What I have here...
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...
...I have retired.
Then give me one of these.
These are not for sale.
Page 15/22
I didn't say "sell me."
I said "give me."
Why should I help you?
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.
And considering the student,
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.
You can sleep here.
It will take me a month...
...to make the sword.
I suggest you spend it practicing.
I've completed doing...
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,
to never do again.
I have created "something that kills people."
And in that purpose, I was a success.
I've done this because philosophically,
I am sympathetic to your aim.
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.
If on your journey, you should encounter God...
God will be cut.
Yellow-haired warrior...
Go.
Domo.
It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny
financially
and philosophically in her
Shakespearean-in-magnitude
power struggle
with the other yakuza clans
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.
When the final sword
was sheathed,
it was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse,
the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.
The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,
Page 16/22
who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale,
another former protge
of Bill's.
The young girl
in the school-girl uniform
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.
Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,
she makes up for in madness.
Do you like Ferraris?
Ferrari... Italian trash.
Do you want to screw me?
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?
Yes.
How 'bout now, big boy?
Do you still wish to penetrate me...
...or is it I...
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?
See what I mean?
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,
the head general of O-Ren's personal army,
the Crazy 88.
And just in case
you were wondering
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.
The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality
came up before the council
only once.
The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.
The man who seems bound
and determined
to break the mood
Page 17/22
is Boss Tanaka.
And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...
Boss Tanaka!
What's the meaning of this outburst?
This is a time for celebration!
And what exactly are we celebrating?
The perversion of our illustrious council?
Tanaka, have you gone mad?
I will not tolerate this!
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?
My father...
...along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.
And while...
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...
...they weep in the afterlife...
- Shut up!
...over the perversion committed today!
Outrageous!
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!
Bastard!
Fuck face!
Gentlemen.
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.
By all means, allow him to express it.
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,
...which I love...
...more than my own children,
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!
So that you understand how serious I am...
...I'm going to say this in English.
As your leader, I encourage you
from time to time,
and always in a respectful manner,
to question my logic.
If you're unconvinced
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,
tell me so.
But allow me to convince you.
Page 18/22
And I promise you,
right here and now,
no subject will ever be taboo.
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.
The price you pay
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!
I didn't think so.
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.
One ticket to Tokyo, please.
Moshi moshi.
Gogo.
Yeah!
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.
They demand ridiculous things.
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?
What's gonna happen?
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?
You're gonna get your head chopped off.
No, I don't want that.
Yes, it's me.
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.
Who do you remind me of?
Charlie Brown!
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.
Charlie Brown.
Four pepperoni pizzas.
That's not on our menu...
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.
O-Ren Ishii!
You and I have unfinished business!
Page 19/22
Charlie Brown, beat it.
Miki.
TEAR THE BITCH APART!
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?
Hi!
Gogo, right?
Bingo.
And you're Black Mamba.
Our reputations precede us.
Don't they?
Gogo, I know you feel
you must protect your mistress.
But I beg you.
Walk away.
You call that begging?
You can beg better than that.
Is that what I think it is?
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.
Silly rabbit.
Trix are for...
Kids.
This is what you get for
fucking around with yakuzas!
Go home to your mother!
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...
...take them with you!
However...
...leave the limbs you've lost.
They belong to me now.
Except you, Sofie!
You stay right where you are.
Your instrument
is quite impressive.
Where was it made?
Okinawa.
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.
YOU LIE!
Swords, however, never get tired.
Page 20/22
I hope you've saved your energy.
If you haven't...
...you might not last five minutes.
But as last looks go,
you could do worse.
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.
But you can at least die
like a samurai.
Attack me...
...with everything you have.
For ridiculing you earlier...
...I apologize.
Accepted.
Ready?
Come on.
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.
My Sofie.
I'm so sorry.
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.
No more of that.
But still...
But still nothing.
Except my aching heart
over what she's done
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.
The first reason is information.
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.
But I am gonna ask you questions.
And every time
you don't give me answers,
I'm gonna cut something off.
And I promise you,
they will be things you will miss!
Give me your other arm!
I want all the information
Page 21/22
on the Deadly Vipers.
If you had to guess...
What they've been doing.
Why she left you alive...
And where I can find them.
What would be your guess?
Guessing won't be necessary.
She informed me.
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.
As I said before,
I've allowed you to keep your wicked life
for two reasons.
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,
everything that happened
here tonight.
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy
by witnessing
your deformed body.
I want you to tell him all
the information you just told me.
I want him to know what I know.
I want him to know
I want him to know.
And I want them all to know
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.
Revenge is never a straight line.
It's a forest.
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...
to get lost... to forget where you came in.
That woman deserves her revenge.
And we deserve to die.
She must suffer
to her last breath.
How did you find me?
I'm the man.
One more thing, Sofie.
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?

Kill Bill: Vol. 2
By Quentin Tarantino
Page 1/41
Do you find me sadistic?
You know, Kiddo...
I'd like to believe you're
aware enough...
even now...
to know that there's
nothing sadistic...
in my actions.
At this moment...
this is me...
at my most masochistic.
Bill...
it's your baby.
Looked dead...
didn't I?
Well, I wasn't.
But it wasn't from lack of trying.
I can tell you that.
Actually, Bill's last bullet...
put me in a coma.
A coma I was to lie
in for four years.
When I woke up...
I went on...
what the movie...
advertisements refer to ass:
A roaring rampage...
of revenge.
I roared...
and I rampaged...
and I got bloody satisfaction.
I've killed a hell of a lot of
people... To get to this point.
But I have only one more.
The last one.
The one I'm driving
to right now.
The only one left.
And when I arrive at my
destination...
I am going to kill Bill.
Now, the incident that happened at
The Two Pines Wedding Chapel...
that put this whole gory
Page 2/41
story into motion...
has since become legend.
"Massacre at Two Pines." That's
what the newspapers called it.
The local TV news called it:
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."
How it happened, who was there...
how many got killed
and who killed them...
changes depending on who's
Telling the story.
In actual fact...
The massacre didn't happen
during a wedding at all.
It was a wedding
rehearsal.
Now, when we come to the part where
I say:
you may kiss the bride.
But don't stick your tongue
in her mouth.
This might be funny
to your friends...
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.
We'll try to restrain ourselves,
Reverend.
Y'all got a song?
How about "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.
Sure.
"Love Me Tender" be great.
Rufus, he's the man.
Rufus, who was that you used
to play for?
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.
I was a Drell.
I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster. I was part of
the Gang. I was a Bar-Kay.
If they come through Texas
Page 3/41
I played them.
Rufus, he's the man.
Have I forgotten anything?
-Oh, yes, you forgot the seating arrangements.
-Thank you, Mother.
Now, the way we
normally do this...
we have the bride's side
and then we have the groom's side.
But since the bride ain't
got nobody coming...
and the groom's got far too
many people coming.
They're coming all the way
from Oklahoma.
Right.
Well, I don't see no problem...
with the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.
-Do you, Mother?
-No, I don't have a problem with that.
But, honey, you know it would be
good if you had somebody come.
You know, as a sign of good faith.
Well, I don't have anybody...
except for Tommy...
And my friends.
You have no family?
I'm working on changing that.
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the
family this little angel's ever going to need.
I'm not feeling very well and this
bitch is starting to piss me off...
So while you all blather on I'm going
to go outside and get some air.
Reverend, sorry.
She's going to get some air.
Given her delicate condition.
She's just needs a few minutes to
get it together. She'll be okay.
Right.
Hello, Kiddo.
How did you find me?
I'm the man.
Page 4/41
What are you doing here?
What am I doing?
Well...
a moment ago,
I was playing my flute.
At this moment...
I'm looking at the most beautiful...
bride these old eyes have
ever seen.
Why are you here?
Last look.
Are you going to be nice?
I've never been nice my whole life.
But I'll do my best
to be sweet.
I always told you...
your sweet side
is your best side.
I guess that's why...
you're the only one who's
ever seen it.
See you got a
bun in the oven.
I'm knocked-up.
Jeez, Louise.
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?
Have you seen Tommy?
Big guy in the tux?
Yes.
Then I saw him. I like his hair.
You promised you'd be nice.
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.
But you're right.
What does your young man
do for a living?
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.
Music lover, eh?
He's fond of music.
Aren't we all.
And what are you doing for
a J-O-B these days?
Page 5/41
I work in the record store.
Aso.
It all suddenly seems so clear.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I like it a lot, smart-ass..
I get to listen to music all day...
talk about music all day.
It's really cool.
It's going to be a great environment...
For my little girl to grow up in.
As opposed to jetting around the
world, killing human beings...
and being paid vast sums of money?
Precisely.
Well, my old friend...
to each his own.
However...
all cockblockery aside...
I am looking forward to meeting
your young man.
I happen to be, more or less
particular whom my gal marries.
You want to come to the wedding?
Only if I can sit on the
bride's side.
You'll find it a bit lonely
on my side.
Your side always was
a bit lonely.
But I wouldn't sit
anywhere else.
You know...
I had the loveliest dream about you.
Oh, here's Tommy.
Call me Arlene.
You must be Tommy. Arlene's told
Me so much about you.
-Honey, you okay?
-Oh, I'm fine.
Tommy, I'd like you to meet
my father.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is great.
I'm so glad to meet you, sir.
Page 6/41
Oh, Dad.
The name's Bill.
Well, it's great to meet you, Bill.
Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
Surprise.
That's my pop for you.
Always full of surprises.
Well, in the surprise department...
the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.
-When did you get in?
-Just now.
-Did you come straight from Australia?
-Of course.
Daddy, I told Tommy that you
were in Perth mining for silver..
and no one could reach you.
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.
So...
what's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals
but I don't believe I've ever heard...
of a wedding dress
rehearsal before.
We thought...
Why pay so much money for a
dress you're only going to wear once?
Especially when Arlene
looks so goddamn beautiful in it.
So, I think we're going to try to get
All the mileage we can out of it.
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck...
for the groom to see the bride in her
wedding dress before the ceremony?
Well, I guess I just believe in living
dangerously.
I know just what you mean.
Son.
Some of us have places to be.
Sure do.
We got to go through this one
more time.
So, why don't you have...
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
Page 7/41
You should give her away.
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.
I think Father'd be more comfortable
sitting with the rest of the guests.
Really?
That's asking a lot.
Well, forget it. But how about we go
Out to dinner tonight, celebrate.
Only if I pay for everything.
Deal.
We got to do this now.
Can I watch?
Absolutely. Have a seat.
Which is the bride's side?
Right over here.
Mother, here we go.
Now, son, about
them vows.
I just wanted...
You don't owe me a damn thing.
If he's the man you want...
then go stand by him.
Do I look pretty?
Thank you.
Oh, good.
It's all much more sim...
What the hell?!
You're telling me...
she cut her way through 88
bodyguards...
before she got to O-Ren?
No, there wasn't really 88 of them.
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88."
-How come?
-I don't know.
I guess they thought it sounded cool.
Anyhow...
they all fell under
her Hanzo sword.
She's got a Hanzo sword?
He made one for her.
Didn't he swear a blood oath to
Page 8/41
Never make another sword?
It would appear he has broken it.
Them Japs sure know how to
Hold a grudge, don't they?
Or maybe...
you just tend to bring that
out in people.
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask it...
but you haven't, by any chance
kept up with your swordplay?
I pawned that years ago.
You hocked a
Hattori Hanzo sword?
It was priceless.
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.
In El Paso,
I got me $250 for it.
I'm a bouncer in a
titty bar, Bill.
If she wants to fight me, she's got
to come to the club, start some shit...
and we'll be in a fight.
I know we haven't spoken
in some time.
And the last time we spoke wasn't
The most pleasant...
but you've got to get over
being mad at me...
and start becoming afraid of...
because she is coming and she's
coming to kill you.
And unless you accept my assistance
I have no doubt she will succeed.
I don't dodge guilt and I don't
Jew out of paying my comeuppance.
Can't we just forget
the past?
That woman deserves
her revenge.
And we deserve to die.
But, then again...
so does she.
So I guess...
Page 9/41
we'll just see...
won't we?
Late again.
Budd, can't you tell time?
There ain't nobody in here, man.
Is that Budd?!
Tell him to get his fucking
ass back here!
Budd, Larry'd like a word with you.
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.
You looking for me?
I don't know what car wash you worked
I don't know what car wash
that let you stroll
in 20 minutes late...
but it wasn't owned by me and
I own a fucking car wash.
-Do you want me to leave?
-No, I want you to sit and wait.
Larry...
there ain't nobody out there, so...
There's nobody out there,
Larry.
What's your point?
That you're not needed here?
My point is...
I'm the bouncer...
and there ain't
nobody out there to bounce.
You're saying that the reason...
that you're not doing the job
that I'm paying you to do...
I'm paying you to do
a job to do?
Is that what you're saying?
What are you trying to convince me of?
That you're as useless as an
asshole right here?
Well, guess what, Buddy...
I think you just fucking
convinced me.
Let's go to the calendar.
It's calendar time.
Page 10/41
Calendar time for Buddy.
Okay, you working tomorrow?
No, you're not. You don't even
know what fucking day you work.
Here. You're not working tomorrow
you're working Wednesday. There
Working Thursday?
I don't think so.
Friday?
There's your name.
-If you say so.
-There used to be your name.
Saturday...
there used to be your name.
So Monday you're going to...
Here, how about that?
Fucking with your cash is
the only thing you kids seem to...
understand. Okay?
Now, I want you to go home till
I call you. Till I call you.
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.
And...
the hat.
That fucking hat.
That fucking hat.
How many times have I told you...
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?
Well, customers wear hats.
Well, I'm not the boss of the
customers. I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...
that I want you to keep that
shit-kicker hat at home.
Yeah, Budd, honey, the toilet
Is at it again.
There's shitty water all over
the floor.
Okay...
Rocket.
I'll clean it up.
Well that gentled you down
Page 11/41
some, didn't it?
Ain't nobody a badass with
a double dose of rock salt...
dug deep in their tits.
Not having...
tits...
as fine...
or as big as yours...
I can't even imagine how bad that
shit must sting.
Yet...
I don't want to neither.
I win..
Bill?
Wrong brother
you hateful bitch.
-Budd.
-Bingo
And to what do I owe this
dubious pleasure?
I just caught me the cowgirl ain't
never been caught.
Did you kill her?
Well, not yet I ain't.
I shot her full
of rock salt.
She's so gentle right now I could...
perform her coup de grace
with a rock.
Anywho...
Guess what I'm holding in my
hand right now.
What?
A brand spanking new
Hattori Hanzo sword.
And I'm here to tell you, Elle...
that's what I call sharp.
How much?
Oh, that's hard to say, being
that it's priceless and all....
What's the terms?
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...
...with a million dollars
Page 12/41
in folding cash...
and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.
How do you like the sound of that?
Sounds like we got a deal.
One condition.
What?
She must suffer to
her last breath.
Well that, Elle, darling...
I can pretty much damn well
guarantee.
Then I'll see you in the morning...
millionaire.
All right.
Wakey, wakey.
Eggs and bakey.
I'm done!
Get me out of this hole!
Good.
Who, look at those eyes.
This bitch is furious.
What did I tell you?
Is she the cutest little blond...
pussy you ever saw?
Or is she the cutest little...
blond pussy you ever saw?
I seen better.
You got anything to say?
White women call this
"the silent treatment."
And we let them think
we don't like it.
You grab the feet
I'll get the head.
Wiggle worm. You see this?
You see it, don't you?
That's a can of Mace.
You're going underneath
the ground tonight.
And that's all there is to it.
I want to bury you.
I was going to bury you...
with this.
Page 13/41
But if you're going to act like
a horse's ass...
I'm going to spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs!
I'll burn them right out
of your fucking head.
Then you're going to be blind...
and burning...
and buried alive.
Now, what's it going to be, sister?
That's a wise decision.
This is for breaking my
brother's heart.
Once upon a time in China...
some believe...
around the year one double
aught-three...
head priest of the
White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei...
was walking down a road...
contemplating whatever it is...
that a man of Pai Mei's infinite
powers would contemplate...
which is another way of saying
"who knows?"...
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road...
traveling in the opposite direction.
As the monk and the priest
Crossed paths...
Pai Mei...
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity...
gave the monk
the slightest of nods.
The nod was not returned.
Now, was it the intention of the
Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?
The motives of the
monk remain unknown.
What is known...
were the consequences.
Page 14/41
The next morning...
Pai Mei appeared at the
Shaolin temple...
and demanded...
of the temple's head abbot that he
offer Pai Mei his neck...
to repay the insult.
The abbot, at first, tried
to console Pai Mei...
only to find Pai Mei was...
inconsolable.
So began...
the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple...
and all 60 of the monks inside...
at the fists of the White Lotus.
And so began the legend...
of Pai Mei's...
Five-Point-Palm...
Exploding-Heart Technique.
Exploding-Heart Technique?
Quite simply...
the deadliest blow in all...
of martial arts.
He hits you with...
his fingertips...
at five different pressure points...
on your body...
and then lets you walk away.
But once you've taken five steps...
your heart explodes...
inside your body...
and you fall to the floor, dead.
Did he teach you that?
He teaches no one...
the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique....
Now...
one of the things I've always...
Liked about you, Kiddo...
is you appear wise beyond
your years.
So allow me to impart a word
to the wise.
Whatever...
Page 15/41
Whatever Pai Mei says.
obey.
If you flash him, even for...
an instant defiant eye...
he'll pluck it out.
And if you throw any...
American sass his way...
he'll snap your back and...
your neck like they were twigs.
And that will be the story of you.
He'll accept you as his student.
-What happened to you?
-Nothing.
-Get in a fight?
-Friendly contest.
Why did he accept me?
Because he's a very, very...
very old man.
And like all...
rotten bastards...
when they become old...
they get lonely.
Which has no effect on their
dispositions...
but it does teach them the value...
of company.
Just seeing those steps again...
makes me ache.
You'll have lots of fun...
carrying buckets...
of water up and down that fucker.
When will I see you again?
That's the title...
of my favorite
Soul song of the '70s.
-What?
-Nothing.
When he tells me you're done.
When do you think that might be?
That, my dearest, depends entirely
on you.
Now remember, no sarcasm,
no backtalk.
At least not for the first year or so.
Page 16/41
You're going to have to let him
warm up to you.
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans...
and has nothing but contempt
For women.
So in your case, it might
take a little while.
Master...
Your Mandarin is lousy.
It causes my ears discomfort.
You bray like an ass!
You are not to speak
unless spoken to.
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?
I speak Japanese very well...
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...
I asked if you understand Cantonese?
A little.
You are here to learn the
mysteries of Kung fu...
not linguistics.
If you don't get me, I'll communicate
with you like I would a dog...
When I yell, when I point, when
I beat you with my stick.
Bill is your master, is he not?
Yes, he is.
Your master tells me,
you're not entirely unschooled.
What training do you possess?
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style.
And I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for Japanese fat heads!
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe
you are my match?
No.
Are you aware I kill at will?
Page 17/41
Yes.
Is it your wish to die?
No.
Then you must be stupid...
Then you must be stupid...so stupid.
Rise, and let me look
at your ridiculous face.
Rise.
So my pathetic friend, Is there
anything that you can do well?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Oh yes, you speak Japanese.
I despise the Goddamn Japs!
Go to that rack.
Remove the sword.
Let's see how good you really are.
If...
you land a single blow...
I'll bow down and call you master.
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.
Your swordsmanship
is amateur at best.
Your so-called kung-fu
is really quite pathetic.
I asked you to demonstrate what you
Know and you did...
Not a goddamn thing!
Let's see your
Tiger Crane...
match my
Eagle's Claw.
Like all Yankee women...
all you can do is order
in restaurants...
and spend a man's
money.
Excruciating, isn't it?
Yes!
If it was my wish...
-I could chop your arm off.
-No, please don't!
It's my arm now.
Page 18/41
I can do what I please.
If you can stop me
I suggest you try.
I can't.
Because you're helpless?
Yes.
Have you ever felt this before?
No.
Compared to me, you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?
Yes!!!
That's the beginning!
Is it your wish to possess this
kind of power?
Yes!
Your training will begin
tomorrow.
Since your arm now belongs to me...
I want it strong.
Can you do that?
-I can, but not that close.
-Then you can't do it.
What if your enemy, is three inches
in front of you...
What do you do then...
Curl into a ball...
or do you put your FIST through him?
Now begin.
It's the wood that should fear your
hand not the other way around.
No wonder you can't do it...
you acquiesce to defeat
before you even begin.
If you want to eat like a dog...
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...
pick up those sticks.
Come on, you bitch.
Okay, Pai Mei.
Here I come.
May I have a glass of water, please?
So,
Page 19/41
that's a Texas funeral?
I have to give it to you, Budd.
That's a
pretty fucked up way to die.
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?
Paula...
Schultz.
Can I look at the sword?
That's my money right there in that
red bag, isn't it?
It sure is.
Well, then, it's your sword now.
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
What's that you said?
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
That's a Hanzo sword all right.
Bill tells me you once had one of
these had one of the of your own.
Yeah, once.
How does this one compare
to that?
If you're going to compare
a Hanzo sword...
you compare it to every other sword
ever made, wasn't made...
by Hattori Hanzo.
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.
So...
which "R" are you filled with?
What?
They say...
the number one killer of old people...
is retirement.
People got a job to do...
they tend to live a little bit longer
so they can do it.
I've always figured that warriors
and their enemies...
share the same relationship.
So now that you won't have to face your
enemy no more on the
which "R" you filled with?
Page 20/41
Relief?
Or regret?
A little bit of both.
Horseshit.
I'm sure you do feel
a little bit of both.
But I know damn well that you feel
one more than you feel the other.
And the question was:
Which one is it?
Regret.
You know, you got to hand it to
the old girl
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.
Bill thought she was so damn smart.
And I tried to tell him, she was just
smart for a blond.
Thanks a bunch.
All right.
I'm sorry, Budd.
That was rude of me, wasn't it?
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.
Black mamba...
this is Budd.
Before I picked that little fella up,
I looked him up on the Internet.
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.
Listen to this:
In Africa, the saying goes:
'In the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you...
and a black mamba can
kill you.
But only with the mamba...
and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time...
is death sure.
Hence its handle,
'Death Incarnate."
Pretty cool, huh?
Its neurotoxic...
Page 21/41
venom is one of nature's
most effective poisons...
acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.
The venom of a black mamba can kill
A human being in four hours...
if, say, bitten on the ankle
or the thumb.
However, a bite to the face
or torso...
can bring death from
paralysis within 20 minutes.
Now, you should listen to this,
because this concerns you.
The amount of venom that's delivered
from a single bite
can be gargantuan.
I've always liked
the word "gargantuan."
I rarely have an opportunity
to use it.
If not treated quickly with
antivenom...
ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to
human beings.
However, the black mamba
can deliver...
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of
venom from a single bite.
Now...
in these last agonizing...
minutes
of life you have left...
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.
Right at this moment...
the biggest "R" I feel
is regret.
Regret of leaving...
maybe the greatest
warrior I have ever met...
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhacking...
scrub, alkie, piece of shit
Page 22/41
like you.
That woman deserved better.
Bill.
I have some tragic news.
Your brother's dead.
I'm so sorry, baby.
She put a black mamba
in his camper.
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.
Let me put it this way:
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.
Take those flowers to Huntington
Cemetery on Fuller and Guadalupe...
look for the headstone
marked Paula Schultz...
and lay them on the grave.
Because you will be standing
at the final resting place.
of Beatrix Kiddo.
-Marty Kistrosser?
-Here.
-Melanie Harrhouse?
-Here.
-Beatrix Kiddo?
-Here.
Look, I can be there in about four hours.
Do you want me to come over?
No. You need me, baby,
I'm there.
I'm leaving now. You go smoke some pot
or something, I'll be there soon.
Gross.
To my brother, Budd. The only
man I ever loved. Bill.
What's that?
Budd's Hanzo sword.
He said he pawned it.
Guess that makes him a liar
now, don't it?
Elle.
B.
Page 23/41
Something I've always
been curious about.
Just between us girls...
what did you say to Pai Mei...
to make
him snatch out your eye?
I called him a
miserable old fool...
Bad idea.
Know what I did?
I killed that miserable
old fool.
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?
I poisoned his
fish heads.
Elle, you treacherous dog.
I give you my word...
And I told him:
To me, the word of an old
fool like you...
is worth...
less than nothing.
That's right.
I killed your master.
And now I'm going to kill you too...
with your own sword, no less.
Which in the very immediate future...
will become my sword.
Bitch...
you don't have a future.
I can't see!
Fucking bitch!
I'll kill you! You're fucking dead!
Fucking dead!!
You bitch! You bitch!
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
I'll get you!
I'm going to kill you!
Where are you?! Let me fucking at you!
Where are you?! Let me fucking at you!
You're fucking dead!
You're dead! I'll kill you,
Page 24/41
you fucking...
Shit!
Shit!
Like most men who never
knew their father,
Bill collected
father figures.
The first was Esteban Vihaio.
Esteban was a pimp and a friend of
Bill's mother.
He ran a brothel in Acuna,
Mexico for over 50 years.
His army, the Acuna Boys...
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.
He ran the
Acuna Boys.
Now, at the age of 80...
it would be this retired
gentleman of leisure...
who could point me
in Bill's direction.
Senor Esteban Vihaio?
May I join you?
Only on the condition that you
call me Esteban.
May I join you, Esteban?
Please.
Americana?
I speak a little Spanish,
if you prefer.
I prefer English.
I haven't spoken it in a while, but
I would relish the opportunity...
to converse with such a pretty
companion as yourself.
It's my pleasure...
to be in the company of
such a fine gentleman as yourself.
I must warn you, young lady...
I am susceptible to flattery.
How may I be of service to you?
Where's Bill?
You must be Beatrix.
Page 25/41
I can see the attraction.
I remember when Bill was only 5 years
old, I took him to the movies.
It was a movie starring
Lana Turner:
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.
And whenever she would appear
on the screen...
Bill would begin compulsively to suck
his thumb to an obscene amount.
his thumb to an obscene amount.
this boy was a fool
for blonds.
You know...
being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...
is always the right thing to do.
If we had met when
I was back in business...
you would have been my
number one lady.
Well, I'm flattered.
You goddamn well better be.
I heard you were driving
A truck.
My Pussy Wagon
died on me.
The Pussy died.
Bill shot you in
the head, no?
I would have been much nicer.
I would have just cut your face.
You must forgive me.
Please, you have a drink with me.
Clarita.
Coming.
What were we talking about?
Bill.
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill?
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.
Page 26/41
I will draw you a map.
Bill is like a son to me.
Do you know why I help you?
Because he would want me to.
Now that I don't believe.
How else is he ever going to
see you again?
Freeze, Mommy.
She got us, B.B.
Mommy got us.
I'm dying.
I'm dying. I'm dy...
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo
know...
that little B.B.
was only playing possum...
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.
I am pervious
to bullets, Mommy.
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.
So as the smirking killer
advanced...
on what she thought was a
bullet-ridden corpse...
that's when little B.B. fired.
You're dead, Mommy. So die.
B.B.
I should've known.
I should've known.
Oh, Mommy, don't die.
I was just playing.
I know.
I told her that you were
asleep...
but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me:
If Mommy's been asleep
since I was born...
then how will she know
Page 27/41
what I look like?
To which I replied:
Because Mommy's been
dreaming of you.
That's what I said.
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.
Let me look at you.
My, what a pretty little girl
you are.
You're pretty too, Mommy.
Tell Mommy what you said when
showed you her picture.
Come on, shy girl.
Come on. You know what you said.
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good.
Yeah. Come on.
I said:
You're the most beautifulest
woman I ever saw...
in the whole wide world.
That's the truth.
That's what she said.
B.B...
don't you think Mommy has the...
prettiest hair in the
whole wide world?
Yes, I do.
Matter of fact,
it's better than pretty.
What's better than pretty?
Gorgeous.
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.
You know, sweetie, Mommy's kind
of mad at Daddy.
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?
Page 28/41
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.
Want to tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?
I killed him.
Emilio was her goldfish.
Emilio was my goldfish.
She came running
into my room...
holding the fish in her hand and
crying, "Daddy. Daddy. Emilio's dead."
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.
How did he die?"
And what did you say?
I stepped on him.
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were:
I accidentally stepped on him.
To which I queried:
"And just how did your foot...
accidentally find its way
into Emilio's fishbowl?"
And she said, "No. Emilio was on
the carpet when I stepped on him."
The plot thickens.
And just how did Emilio get
on the carpet?
And, Mommy, you would have
been so proud of her.
She didn't lie.
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...
and put him on the carpet.
And what was Emilio doing
on the carpet?
Flapping.
And then you stomped on him.
And when you lifted up your foot...
what was Emilio doing then?
Nothing.
He stopped flapping, didn't he?
She told me later...
Page 29/41
that the second she lifted up her
foot and saw Emilio not flapping...
she knew what she had done.
Is that not the perfect visual image
of life and death?
A fish flapping
on the carpet...
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.
So powerful...
even a 4-year-old with
no concept of life or death...
knew what it meant.
You loved Emilio, didn't you?
Well...
I love Mommy too...
But I did to Mommy what
you did to Emilio.
-You stomped on Mommy?
-Worse.
I shot Mommy.
Not pretend shooting like
we were just doing.
I shot her for real.
Why? Did you want to see what would
what would happen?
No, I knew what would happen to
Mommy If I shot her.
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.
What happened?
I was very sad.
And that's when I learned:
Some things, once you do...
they can never be undone.
What happened
to Mommy?
Why don't you ask Mommy?
You okay, Mommy? Did it hurt?
No, sweetie.
Doesn't hurt anymore.
Did it make you sick?
It made me sleep.
That's why I haven't been with you,
B.B. I've been asleep.
Page 30/41
But you're awake now, Mommy, right?
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
B.B., would you like Mommy to
watch a video with you...
before sleepy time?
Mommy, do you want to watch a
video with me before sleepy time?
Oh, yeah! I would love to.
-Which one do you want to watch?
-Shogun Assassin.
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin is too long.
No, it's not.
Well, then, I'll leave
you ladies to it.
When I was little...
my father was famous.
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.
And he was the
shogun's decapitator.
He cut off the heads
of 131 lords.
My father would come
home to Mother...
And when he would see her he would
forget about the killings.
He wasn't scared
of the shogun...
but the shogun
was scared of him.
Maybe that was the problem.
One night...
The shogun sent his
ninja spies...
I was just admiring
your sword.
Quite a piece of work.
Speaking of which, how is
Hanzo-san?
He's good.
Has his sushi gotten any better?
You know, I couldn't
believe it.
-You got him to make you a sword.
Page 31/41
-It was easy.
I just dropped your name,
Bill.
That'd do it.
I suppose the idea is we
cross Hanzo swords.
Am I right?
Well...
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.
And that private beach...
just so happens to look particularly
beautiful bathed in moonlight.
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.
So, swordfighter...
if you want a swordfight,
that's where I suggest.
But if you want to be old school
about it...
and you know I'm all
about old school then we could wait...
until dawn and slice each other...
up at sunrise like
a couple of real-life, honest...
Now, if you don't settle down,
I'll have to put one in your kneecap...
And I hear tell that's
a very painful...
place to get shot in.
I'm just fucking with you.
Now...
when it comes to you...
and us...
I have a few unanswered
questions.
So...
before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax...
I'm going to ask you some questions
and I want you to tell me the truth.
However, therein lies a dilemma.
Because, when it comes to the
subject of me...
Page 32/41
I believe you are truly and
utterly incapable
of telling the truth.
Especially to me.
And least of all to yourself.
And when it comes to the
subject of me...
I am truly and
utterly incapable...
of believing anything
you say.
How do you suppose we
solve this dilemma?
Well it just so happens...
I have a solution.
Gotcha!
Goddamn!
What the fuck did you just
shoot me with?!
My greatest invention.
Or at least
my favorite.
Don't touch it or I'll stick another
one right in your cheek.
What lies within that dart...
just begging to course its way
through your veins...
is an incredibly potent...
infallible truth serum.
I call it
"The Undisputed Truth."
Twice as strong as
sodium pentothal...
with no druggie aftereffects.
Except for a slight wave
of euphoria.
You feel it?
Euphoria?
Too bad.
As you know...
I'm quite keen
on comic books.
Especially the ones
about superheroes.
Page 33/41
I find the whole mythology surrounding
superheroes fascinating.
Take my favorite
superhero, Superman.
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.
But the mythology...
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?
About two minutes. Just long enough for
me to finish my point.
Now a staple of the superhero
mythology is...
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne...
Spider-Man is
actually Peter Parker.
When that character wakes up
In the morning, he's Peter Parker.
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.
And it is in...
that characteristic
Superman stands alone.
Superman didn't
become Superman.
Superman was born Superman.
When Superman wakes up in the
morning, he's Superman.
His alter ego
is Clark Kent.
His outfit with
the big red "S"...
that's the blanket...
he was wrapped in as a baby
when the Kents found him.
Those are his clothes.
What Kent wears, the glasses, the
business suit, that's the costume.
That's the costume Superman wears to
blend in with us.
Page 34/41
Clark Kent is how
Superman views us.
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?
He's weak...
he's unsure of himself...
he's a coward.
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and
Mrs. Tommy Plympton.
Aso.
The point emerges.
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plympton...
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.
Oh, you can take the needle out.
Are you calling
me a superhero?
I'm calling
you a killer.
A natural Born killer.
You always have been
and you always will be.
Moving to El Paso...
working in a used record store...
going to the movies with Tommy...
clipping coupons.
That's you trying to disguise
yourself as a worker bee.
That's you trying to blend in
with the hive.
But you're
not a worker bee.
You're a renegade
killer bee.
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate...
or how fat your ass got...
nothing in the world would
ever change that.
Page 35/41
First question:
Did you really think your life in El
Paso was going to work?
But I would've had B.B.!
Don't get me wrong, I think you
would've been a wonderful mother.
But you are a killer.
All those people you
killed to get to me...
felt damn good, didn't they?
Every single one of them?
Every single
one of them?
Now comes the
$64,000 question.
Why did you run away from me
with my baby?
Do you remember the last assignment
You sent on me.
Of course.
Lisa Wong.
The morning I left,
I was sick.
On the plane, I threw up.
So I started thinking:
Maybe I was pregnant.
Easy to use.
Remove cap and urinate on
the absorbent end for five seconds.
Accurate results in
only 90 seconds.
You can read the results as soon as the
line appears in the window.
Fuck.
What I didn't know...
was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.
With me in L.A.,
it didn't take Li Wong long...
to send an assassin of her own.
Hello, can I help you?
I'm Karen Kim, the hospitality manager.
I have a welcome gift
from management.
Page 36/41
That's nice...
Can you leave it by the door?
You pretty good with that shotgun?
Not that I have to be at this range.
But I'm a surgeon with this shotgun.
Well, guess what, bitch.
I'm better than Annie Oakley.
And I got you right in my sight.
I could blow your fucking head off.
Not before I put one right between
your eyes, so let's talk.
Karen...
I just found out...
right now...
not a moment before you
blew a hole through the door...
that I'm pregnant.
What is this?
On the floor by the door...
is a strip that says
I'm pregnant.
Bullshit.
Any other time you'd
be 100 percent right.
This time...
you're 100 percent wrong.
I'm the deadliest woman
in the world.
But right now I'm just scared
shitless for my baby.
Please.
Just look at the strip.
Please.
Stay where you are
and don't move.
I don't know what this shit means.
The box with the directions
is there.
Easy to use.
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end.
Blue means pregnant.
I'll read it myself, thank you.
Say I were to believe you.
Page 37/41
What then?
Just go home.
I'll do the same.
Congratulations.
Before that
strip turned blue...
I was a woman,
I was your woman.
I was a killer who killed
for you.
Before that strip turned blue...
I would've jumped a motorcycle
onto a speeding train.
For you.
But once that strip
turned blue...
I could no longer do any
of those things.
Not anymore.
Because I was going
to be a mother.
Can you understand that?
But why didn't you tell
me then instead of now?
Once you knew,
you'd claim her.
Not your
decision to make.
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.
But with you...
she would've been born into a world
she shouldn't have.
I had to choose.
I chose her.
You know, five years ago...
if I had to make a list...
of impossible things
that could never happen...
you performing a coup de grace
on me by busting a cap in my crown...
would've been right at the
Page 38/41
top of the list.
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?
I'm sorry.
Was that a question?
Of impossible things that
could never happen..
yes, in this instance you
would've been wrong.
Well?
When you never came back...
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong or
somebody else...
had killed you.
And for the record...
letting somebody think...
somebody they
love is dead when they're not...
is quite cruel.
I mourned you
for three months.
And in the third month of
mourning you...
I tracked you down.
I wasn't trying to track you down.
I was trying to track down the fucking
assholes I thought killed you.
So I find you...
and what do I find?
Not only are
you not dead...
you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.
And you're pregnant.
I overreacted.
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?
I didn't say I would explain myself.
I said I would tell you the truth.
But if that's too cryptic,
let's get literal.
I'm a killer.
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.
And there are consequences...
Page 39/41
to breaking the heart of
a murdering bastard.
You experienced some of them.
Was my reaction
really that surprising?
It was.
Could you do what you did?
Of course you could.
But I never thought...
you would or could
do that to me.
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...
but you thought wrong.
You and I have
unfinished business.
Baby...
you ain't kidding.
Pai Mei taught you
the Five-Point-Palm...
Exploding-Heart
Technique?
Course he did.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
Because I'm...
a bad person.
You're not a bad person.
You're a terrific person.
You're my favorite person.
But every once in a while...
you can be a real cunt.
How do I look?
You look ready.
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America
and all the ships at sea.
Let's go to press. Flash.
Do you have a magpie in your home?
If you do, you are most
The magpie is the most charming
bird in all the world.
He's the best friend a
farmer ever had.
Page 40/41
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.
And always remember, the magpie
deserves your respect.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.
I ain't got no headache.
Oh, yes, you have, brother.
Mark it.
And, action!
Cut.
Oh, come on, let's do it again.

Django Unchained
By Quentin Tarantino
Page 1/184
EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY
As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its
own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.
The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are
slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).
One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in
the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into
his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back
which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.
As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of
misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through
blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare
feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take
the
skin off ankles.
AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually
the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil
characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at
the
Greenville Auction.
DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of
the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.
He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the
distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the
Page 2/184
distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to
whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.
As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;
DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell
designed
for forty.
WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and
lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.
The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in
front
of the auction block.
2
DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually
doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their
turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room
full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the
side.
DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for
white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.
It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought
up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want
to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.

blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. -

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.
/--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT
It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep
pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky
to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the
creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up
on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the
chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven
slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact
the
seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a
lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in
unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both
Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and
white
fur collars.
WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road.
This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready
their
rifles for possible trouble.

Page 4/184
A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background
to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider
carries.
THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long
grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey
bowler
hat on his head.
DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!
THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in
front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to
his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.
THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?
ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?
THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor
taught
him.
DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.
DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?
Page 5/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?
ACE SPECK
So what?
LE
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.
ACE SPECK
Speak English!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the
second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the
darkness a
VOICE rings out;
DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?
DJANGO
Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Page 6/184
Dr.Schultz is delighted.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?
DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
ï¿ó. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage
their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.
ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?
ACE SPEC
Like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain
ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.
ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.
ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?
ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants
Dr.SCHULTZ
Page 7/184
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of
his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.
Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the
Germans
direction...
BAM...
Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg,
we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill
another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining
Speck.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he
stands over
Dicky's body.
DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...
(COUNTING OUT
THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.
Page 8/184
DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!
Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?
DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?
DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's
PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she
stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE
BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through
the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into
the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their
amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their
wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they
squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make
him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their
belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.
Page 9/184
BACK TO DJANGO
DJANGO
I can point 'em out.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?
DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?
DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?
DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.
8
The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat
pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes
out a
Page 10/184
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and
tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the
saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around
and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm
jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?
9
DJANGO
Huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire
Page 11/184
the
way it looks.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned
down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good
doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket
knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six
Slaves, in
leg irons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;
Page 12/184
0
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.
EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their
horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django
wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down
dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque
scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?
DJANGO
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?
DJANGO
What horse?
Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.
DJANGO
This ain't my horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.
DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.
Page 13/184
/1
DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes
himself...
then says with a smile;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -
DJANGO
- Tony.
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?
DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?
DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?
DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward
a
Page 14/184
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO
DAUGHTREY,
TEXAS"
/Z
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.
EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride
Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?
DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?
DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts.
Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it
gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
Page 15/184
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?
DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?
13
DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?
DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.
DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.
INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk
into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on
a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is
turned
away from the two patrons.
Page 16/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.
SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.
SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.
IT
TIME CUT
EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes
running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two
beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat,
asks;
DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
Page 17/184
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of
beer,
HE EXPLAINS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.
15
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.
DJANGO
What's a bounty?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.
DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.
DJANGO
White people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.
DJANGO
Page 18/184
Bad people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.
(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel

DJANGO
- Where we goin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you

I've already gave him to you -- but once the

Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.
EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling
a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand
around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.
SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;
1 2
SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.
.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the
dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in
the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
Page 20/184
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff,
reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;
PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law
man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats
scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.

U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to
attention.
MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.
LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof
of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.
WHEN...
COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...
INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon
number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a
Page 21/184
lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed
curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his
weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a
table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?
DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.
(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?
DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?
DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.
)9
Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?
DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.
MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.
MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
Page 22/184
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!
Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?
MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.
MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?
MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."
EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Page 23/184
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised,
step
outside.
MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?
MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.
MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.
Z/
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
Page 24/184
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.
CUT TO
EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the
way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical
grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his
feet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?
DJANGO
What'cha mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?
DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?
DJANGO
Huh?
ZZ
Dr.SCHULTZ
Page 25/184
Do slaves believe in marriage'?
DJANGO
Me and my wife do.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?
DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?
DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,
SCHULTZ SAYS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment
contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?
DJANGO
A few months ago.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?
DJANGO
Three.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.
Page 26/184
Z3
Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.
DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?
DJANGO
They could do that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.
DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.
DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.
EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE
that.

he's
wearing explains the distress.

that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.
CUT TO
EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed
in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the
property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django
leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the
front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the
SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare
in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT,
dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of
the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the
white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
Page 28/184
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a
stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to
look up
at the darkee on the horse.
SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.
Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.
SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -
Z .ate`
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.
SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.
SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.
Page 29/184
SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.
SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer
Bennett.
Spencer laughs.
ZG
SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.
SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal
named
BETINA, snaps to attention.
BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?
SPENCER
(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?
Page 30/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.
SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.
BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.
SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?
BETINA
Yes, sir?
SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?
BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?
SPENCER
No that's not what I said.
BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.
SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.
(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;
MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.
Page 31/184
SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.
(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?
BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.
SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.
EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the
grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head,
and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are
quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.
BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?
DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.
BETINA
So you really free?
DJANGO
Yes.
ZY
BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.
EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch
drinking
lemonade.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.
SPENCER
Page 32/184
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?
SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.
BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.
DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this
fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less
interested.
BETINA
What'cho want?
DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?
BETINA
Brittle?
DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.
BETINA
I don't know dem.
DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.
BETINA
Page 33/184
You mean The Shaffer's?
DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?
BETINA
Ah-huh.
DJANGO
Are they here?
BETINA
Ah-huh.
DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?
BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse,
whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens
it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might
use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it
against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the
cotton
field landscape.
SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER,
but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to
Django's
observation.

He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.
DJANGO
Where's the other two?
BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.
DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.
DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.
BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."
DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between
him
and The Brittle Brothers.
FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers
giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being
whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his
BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.
3/
DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.
Page 35/184
DJANGO
(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!
LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big
John
Brittle with everything he has.
BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express
train.
FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to
the
KNEELING DJANGO;
BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.
EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl
(eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his
WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for
mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.
BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass
to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little
friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE
FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django
pays the
little dogs no nevermind.
Page 36/184

BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.
BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.
DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They
don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...
WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;
DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded
full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against
the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin
Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up
see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.
LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's
going to
shake his hand ...
DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a
tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.
Page 37/184
BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up,
clutching his
heart, at Django.
DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.
3 3
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the
background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling
for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste,
he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.
DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground,
picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into
Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?
DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?
DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
Page 38/184
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field
trying
to make an escape.
SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...
DJANGO
Yes!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...
DJANGO
I dunno.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...
DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.
DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?
DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his
OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Page 39/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!
SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?
35;
Drï¿ó. SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --
DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.
SPENCER
Gimmie.
Page 40/184
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands
it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself,
resigned to
what it says.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?
36
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?
BENNETT
Get off my land.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.
(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.
TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra
horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black
man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in
their way
for one final threat.
BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
Page 41/184
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

CU SPENCER BENNETT
lying on his belly in the grass.
SPENCER BENNETT
That's them sonsabitches.
SPENCER'S POV:
We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set
up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle
Brothers
lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER
RIFLE
CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON
HORSEBACK,
Page 42/184
all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and
mouth
holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
steed..
SPENCER BENNETT
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over
his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the
sack;
SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make
the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more
obscured.
BRADSHAW
We ready, or what?

SPENCER BENNETT
Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.
(RIPS)
Shit ...I just made it worse.
He rips. it off his head in frustration.
RANDY
I can't see shit either.
REDFISH
Who made this goddamn shit?

Willards wife.
WILLARD
Well make you own goddamn masks!
SPENCER
Page 43/184
(TO WILLARD)
Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
what Jenny did.
REDFISH
Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
could cut it better then this.
0. B.
How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?
ROBERT
Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
all over, and I'm riding blind.
Randy tears at his bag.
RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;
RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.
RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?
TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!
3 9
RANDY
I'm just asking.
DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?
SPENCER
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.
REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!
WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
Page 44/184
ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.
SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
not dead.
O.B.
But Willards riding off.
SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.
RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;
ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.
SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!
YO
TERRY
But nobody can see.
SPENCER
So?
TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.
SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as
well.
EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
Page 45/184
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding
over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on
his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and
Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.
WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH
BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked
us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish
fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...
WE SNAP ZOOM TO
A BIG TREE
on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.
Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.
SCOPE SIGHT POV
The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground,
are

TWO SHOT
Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Auf wiedersehen.

He fires.
The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let 'em have it!
DJANGO
I can't see nothin'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Page 46/184
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.
INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get
the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in
panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown
up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't
see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which
causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can
still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering
like
dogs.
SPENCER BENNETT

SCOPE SIGHT POV
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross
hairs.

INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.
SPENCER BENNETT
we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the
whistling of
what sounds like an incoming missle.
SPENCER BENNETT
we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's
bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.
DJANGO
DJANGO
I got 'em.
SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.
DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;
DJANGO
I like.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.
MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets
his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores
to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by
Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks
damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy
Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy
Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe
Page 48/184
Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter
Coat as
his winter coat.
EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides
alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.
DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?
DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?
DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Page 49/184
Your wife?
DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?
DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?
TIME CUT
EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread
out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and
drinks a
cup of tea.
DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.
DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.
DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.
DJANGO
Do you know it?
Page 50/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
DJANGO
What she do.?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -
DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.
DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.
DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.
DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize
Page 51/184
something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, Sigfried.
DJANGO
Does Sigfried save her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
he's not afraid.of him.
Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
He walks through hellfire because
Broomhilda's worth. it.
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a
moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.
DJANGO
I know how he feels.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot,
as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
the bounty hunting business?
DJANGO
Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
What's not to like?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hafta admit, we make a good team.
Page 52/184
DJANGO
But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Big John and Rodger?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
the winter?
DJANGO
What'd ya mean partner up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
for the winter.
DJANGO
You makin' another agreement?
W7
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
to need to know.
DJANGO
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
understandably, he's a little suspicious.
DJANGO
Page 53/184
Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django
and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears
Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.
WE SEE
A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his
hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's
going
to be good at this.
EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz
have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE
(named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in
'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small
farmhouse.
Y, 8
DOWN BELOW WE SEE
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD
SON
Page 54/184
helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Keep down or he'll see you.
DJANGO
Who that farmer? Who cares?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
just might.
DJANGO
What? The little man pushin' that plow?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.
DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
who's hiding out as a farmer, because
there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And he's all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.
SCOPE SIGHT POV:
on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his
horse
and his son.
Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
folks for money?
DJANGO
His son's with him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word. That's
better then most get, and a damn. sight
better then he deserves.

Page 55/184
Django still hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan
pants.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.
DJANGO
(READING)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and
CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
twenty-two, they would never of printed that.
(REFERRING TO
THE HANDBILL)
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what
I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he
figures'out
his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.
DJANGO
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's good luck. You always keep the
handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's
Page 56/184
body,
leading the extra body horse behind them.
50
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty
Bacall's
Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking
his
last words to his son before he dies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, they're having a tender little father son
moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
they've ever had.
EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He
sticks
a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the
snowman's
heart would be.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the bottle heart!
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the left coal eye.
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the right coal eye.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the carrot nose.
Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think it's safe to say you're faster then
the snowman.
EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride
through
a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are
SHOT

The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride
down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED
DOWN
with five corpses.

The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows
them.
SHERIFF GUS
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?
Dr.SCHULTZ
The Wilson - Lowe Gang.
SHERIFF GUS
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and
hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
And three of their acolytes.
SHERIFF GUS
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.
TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours
them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On
the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar
bounty,
"That one", Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine
bounty
Page 58/184
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.
EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow
Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting
another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.
5L
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You're pretty confident aren't you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops
them on
top of Django.
DJANGO
Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh you're ready for Greenville.
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
sure.
He blows out the match...
WE GO TO BLACK
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a
lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top
of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own
man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

CUT TO
EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of
shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave
feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the
other.
53
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their
horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The
buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you
look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move
them
along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and
pretty
PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY
MOVING
THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:
GREENVILLE
CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings
sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the
Page 60/184
BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six
Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main
Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge
SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the
depot.
WE FLASH ON
The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.
INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the
train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the
boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO
WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.
JUDD
Good god almighty these niggers stink!
I F
RUSS
Niggers stink, where's the shock?
(to the Slaves
BELOW)
Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
well, I'm only gonna say this once.
There's a slave corral right across from
this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
any African garboons amongst y'all can't
understand english ... . your American buddies
Page 61/184
better shove your ass in the right direction,
or your trip to this country is going to be
short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
you can!
The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.
INSIDE THE CORRAL
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them
open up
the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen
out of
view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the
other
LADIES, then she's gone from view.
BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight
of
Greenville.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a spectacle out of Dante.
DJANGO
You should see it from the other side.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.
DJANGO
You'd be surprised what you can endure.
(BEAT)
Where to?

Records office.
CUT TO
INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with
books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white
Page 62/184
man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian
looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with
words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.
BLACK TITLE CARD:
BROOMHILDA
INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the
bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.
EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen
by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud,
and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only
been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from
his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will
shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led
out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of
Main
Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that
Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a
parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the
TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.
BROOMHILDA
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as
ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is
Page 63/184
his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.
Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES
MEET,
he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then
her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the
sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers
don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more
gentle.
SELLER - CLYDE
Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
nigger gal gentle.
UGLY MAN
makes a bid.
BROOMHILDA
yikes.
UGLIER MAN

BROOMHILDA
reacts.

Mr.Harmony makes a bid for his son Scotty.
Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
Page 64/184
They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.
NARRATOR (VO)
On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new
owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda
up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.
SCOTTY
This is for you.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.
SCOTTY
They're jelly beans. Try one.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.
SCOTTY
Good huh?
She nods her head, yes.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda
in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.
$XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in
the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's
beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.
BROOMHILDA
Master Scotty... ?
SCOTTY
Yes Broomhilda?
BROOMHILDA
I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?
SCOTTY
Page 65/184
Please, I'd love that.
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.
'8
EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a
plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the
fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her
son, and
his new bought nigger gal.
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
Mrs.HARMONY
What's your name, gal?
BROOMHILDA
Broomhilda.
Mrs.HARMONY
Follow me. into the kitchen,
('to her son)
You stay out here.
INT - KITCHEN - DAY
Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC
SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony
grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
Mrs.HARMONY
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
wrong, you'll deal with me.
BROOMHILDA
I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
needs is a little confidence.
Page 66/184
Mrs.HARMONY
And you'll give that to him?
BROOMHILDA
I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
Mrs.HARMONY
He is, isn't he?
BROOMHILDA
Ah-huh.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

NARRATOR (VO)
Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
house for awhile.
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly
nets in
the daytime..
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.
NARRATOR (VO)
As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes
and
gravy.

NARRATOR (VO)
After three months of this bliss,
Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
a romantic weekend in Greenville.
SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the
nines, in a
fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace
dress,
complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white
parasol.
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion
best
described as plantation pimp daddy.
6O
NARRATOR (VO)
White masters would take their pretty
Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
how bad the other slaves had it, always made
the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
position, (just in case they'd forgot).
BROOMHILDA
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches
the
OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.
INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy
hotel
lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.
INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY
Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the

INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE

MASTERS
showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.
NARRATOR (VO)
And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.
EXT - CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT

Club.

INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you
mean
white men and black women).
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs
dining
room.
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN
CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing
Broomhilda.
SCOTTY
I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he
Page 69/184
needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.
NARRATOR (VO)
Then... speak of the devil and the devil
appears.
CALVIN CANDIE
appears at their table.
CALVIN CANDIE
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
to welcome an attractive couple'like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.
SCOTTY
Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
We love it here.
Pointing at a empty chair.
CALVIN CANDIE
May I join you?-
SCOTTY
Please, by all means.
Calvin sits down.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.
CALVIN CANDIE
How long have you been a member?
SCOTTY
We just joined this weekend.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.
SCOTTY
Well said, and money well spent.
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
Candie sees this.
CALVIN CANDIE
It would be.my pleasure, your first
Page 70/184
weekend at the club, to join me and my
friends at my table.
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin
Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes
her off
with a, "Don't be silly."
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and
they
join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose
dress
is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time.
But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and
it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table
to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends
he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to
Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around
making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the
hotel.
NARRATOR (VO)
After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
scrape every pimple.

ï¿ó-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his
friends.
NARRATOR (VO)
Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
something in his ear.
CANDIE
(TO SHEBA)
Really?
(TO SCOTTY)
You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;
SCOTTY
What?
CANDIE
She says she thinks you're cute.
SCOTTY
Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
beautiful.
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.
CANDIE
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
lip. Want some lip?
Scotty, is a little surprised.
SCOTTY
Well, she's your Pony...I mean...
CANDIE
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a
very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes
back to
Calvin's side of the table.
The game continues.
Page 72/184
G
CANDIE
Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
Candie throws in his chips.
SCOTTY.
I see your five hundred...
(throws in chips)
.and raise you four hundred more.
(tosses his last chips)
Call.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.
CALVIN CANDIE
Not so fast, boy.
(BEAT)
Pot ain't fat enough yet.
SCOTTY
I'm all in.
CALVIN CANDIE
Ain't that too bad.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of
his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.
SCOTTY
I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.
CALVIN CANDIE
One final raise.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"
CALVIN CANDIE
It's Sheba's bill of sale.
SCOTTY
What? I don't want her.
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.
CALVIN CANDIE
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
More laughter.
Page 73/184
CALVIN CANDIE
In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
fold?
SCOTTY
I'm all out of money.
CALVIN CANDIE
But we ain't playin' for money no more..
We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
you got.
SCOTTY
I can't bet Broomhilda.
CALVIN CANDIE
In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
and a pencil.
Somebody does.
CALVIN CANDIE
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
Scotty makes a pressured decision.
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
Broomhilda.
SCOTTY
Let me see your cards!
Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.
SCOTTY
You cheated me.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.
CALVIN CANDIE
What did you just call me?
SCOTTY
I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
cause that's what you are!
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small
Derringer
Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of
Scotty.
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
himself .
Page 74/184
66
Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.
CALVIN CANDIE
Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
I challenge you to a duel.
(to the Piano
PLAYER)
Piano player, will you hit three separate
notes?
(TO SCOTTY)
On the third note, pick up the gun and
try to kill me.
(to Piano player)
Piano player please ...
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.
SCOTTY
Wait a minute ...no!
FIRST NOTE ...
SCOTTY
I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
to duel!
CALVIN CANDIE
Then get out of here, get in your buggy
and get out of town.
SCOTTY
Sure. Let me just get my girl.
CALVIN CANDIE
You lost that girl, fat boy.
SECOND NOTE...
SCOTTY
Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
give you Broomhilda.
CALVIN CANDIE
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
to fuckin' another one.
(BEAT)
Or pick up that gun.
Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face
his
Page 75/184
parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he
can't
leave.

CALVIN CANDLE
Hello Oliver.
FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER)
Hello Mr.Candie, good evening.
CALVIN CANDLE
Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver.
Could you please inform me which room
your guest Scott Harmony is staying in?
INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Broomhilda is asleep in bed...
WHEN ...
.Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand.
He
YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda
lies
naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her
legs and
backside.
She hops out of bed.
INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the
stairs,
down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door.
All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS.
EXT - GREENVILLE HOTEL - NIGHT
She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE
GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie

CALVIN CANDIE

Welcome to Candyland.
We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face.
NARRATOR (VO)
That was four months ago.
CUT TO
INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or
sold
fill the big hall.
ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
stands half naked on the auction block.
The SELLER' (SHELBY)
gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the
bidding.
Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo,
including
Calvin Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
/-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and
bowler
hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
owner of Candyland.
DJANGO
Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, so you heard of it?
DJANGO
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
and apparently the repellent gentleman down
there is the one who owns her.
Page 77/184
ï¿óï¿ó` TIME CUT
6R
The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the
auction
hall.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?
DJANGO
Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
a couple niggers he'd fight.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you play a mandingo expert?
DJANGO
What?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on mandingo fighters?
DJANGOÂ€¢
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Because when a man has one of the four
biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
his attention, we better be talking about
big sweaty black males. So my character is
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
fight game. And your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.
DJANGO
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
Dr.SCHULTZ.
One-Eyed Charly?
DJANGO
That's what you call it when you buy a slave
expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
Page 78/184
don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr'. SCHULTZ
Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?
70
DJANGO
You know, back on the plantation, my. job
wasn't historian.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
yes, if you can't.
DJANGO
You want me to play a black slaver? There
ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
Django gets that.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you do that?
DJANGO
That, I can do. What's next?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To get ourselves personally invited to
Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.
CUT TO
EXT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra
Club.
Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among
other.nice
houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville
Mississippi.
They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the
stoop
steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens
Page 79/184
the
door.
FRENCH MAID
(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Bonjour.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(AMUSED)
Bonjour, mon petite femme noire.
We are here to see Calvin Candie.
7)
She's been taught to smile and say:
FRENCH MAID
Enter.
The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.
HOSTESS
(SPEAKING QUITE
REFINED)
Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
associate, Django Freeman.
Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We're here for a appointment with
Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.
CLEO
Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
Monsieur Candie you've arrived.
(referring to the
FRENCH MAID)
Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
a tasty refreshment?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not at the moment.
CLEO
Then Coco will entertain you while I
inform Monsieur Candie.
Page 80/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
How charming.
Cleo leaves.
Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.
INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The
DINERS
are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN, and pretty
BLACK
GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of
the day.
72
Some appear to be on dates.
Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday,
anniversary,
special treat).
- Some are.two men with two women.
Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty
beef
driven American dining.
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete
with
elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge,
banana
splits, and cookies.
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
sarsaparilla.
Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
Django shakes his head, no.
COCO CHIRPS;
COLO. -
(VERY COUNTRY)
Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
Page 81/184
like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we
got sand dabs.
LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.
MOGUY
Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity for this
appointment.
Mr.MOGUY
Nonsense, it's my job.
(CON'T)
73
Mr.MOGUY
(CON'T)
(LOOKING AT
DJANGO)
.So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
so much about.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.
MOGUY
Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
along too?
Dr.SCHULTZ
We would be quite lucky indeed if the
charming Coco cared.to follow.
Coco blushes.
MOGUY
You better watch out doctor, you gonna
steal this little pony's heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they
do they
SAY;
Dr.SCHULTZ
How long have you been associated with
Mr.Candie?
Page 82/184
MOGUY
Calvin and I were about eleven when we
went to boarding school together. One
could almost say, I was raised to be
Calvin's lawyer.
DJANGO
One could almost say, you a nigger.
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just
said to
Mr.Moguy.
MOGUY
What did you say?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
know before I meet him?
MOGUY
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.
7EF
Dr.SCHULTZ
What civilized people aren't?
MOGUY
That's why all the French ambiance. And
he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ
(FRENCH)
What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.
MOGUY
Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open...
The party enters the billiard room.
INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still
dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and
Page 83/184
savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo
that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name
is.AMERIGO
VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new
arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin
says;
CALVIN CANDIE
Why do you want to get in the mandingo
business?
That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
(referring to Moguy)
.to make the proper introductions?
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;
7S
CALVIN CANDIE
Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
The awful truth?
(PAUSE)
I'm bored, and it seems like a good
bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun_
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he
preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other
Page 84/184
to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.
CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?
MOGUY
Big Fred.
CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.
(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?
AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the
fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave
bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.
CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?
DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.
CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?
79
Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.
CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the
BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.
CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
Page 85/184
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both
take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.
(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?
DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;
BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?
77
/ï¿ó. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.
CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.
CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Page 86/184
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.
CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...
(POINTING TO
SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.
(POINTING TO
DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white
man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.
FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..
BACK TO CLEO CLUB
DJANGO
Not for top dollar.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.
Page 87/184
DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.
CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?
CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?
Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?
DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.
CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.
TIME CUT
TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat
dinner
in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats
Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.
77
CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO COCO)
Page 88/184
How's your Catfish, dew drop?
COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?
COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?
SHEBA
Yep.
CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?
DJANGO
(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so
good.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
Page 89/184
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.
WE CUT
EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE
OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard
filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus
JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville
Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.
THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER)
WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville
are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate
is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey
Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win,
like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.
Page 90/184
J
RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All
the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.
FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these
three.
RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.
DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't
let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;
DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.
RODNEY
No sir.
DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?
RODNEY
No sir.
DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in
check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?
DJANGO
Not so much.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?
DJANGO
I didn't say that.
Page 91/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.
DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.
DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.
SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...
CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.
CALVIN CANDIE
(APPRAISING THE
TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the
distance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?
Page 92/184
1?3
CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.
CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front
teeth,
rides up.
BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?
CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!
BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
Page 93/184
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk,
but his
ï¿ó, emotions betray nothing.
PTE
CALVIN CANDIE
(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.
CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?
BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.
CALVIN CANDIE
Who?
CUT TO
EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down
runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland
Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing,
dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX,
and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and
sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one
SNARLING
Page 94/184
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name
of
MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at
him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in
one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES
have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human
bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.
O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He
hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan
look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and
the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?
D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other
Page 95/184
TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.
CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.
CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.
CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.
MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.
(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.
D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
Page 96/184
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured
runaway
on the ground.
CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times
before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and
Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of
D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like,
poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.
CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?
E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn
in the
direction of the good German.
CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket
pocket.
Page 97/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.
CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.
DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.
DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always
preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in
the
green jacket, slack jawed.
!` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.
CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black
man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
Page 98/184
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?
DJANGO
He's your nigger.
CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...
THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't
blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then
back
ï¿ó-. to Django.
P9
CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.
DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.
CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?
DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
Page 99/184
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs
up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.
CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear
D'Artagnan
apart.
EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his
sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of
Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of
SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on
earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a
Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton,
the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature
and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees
Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of
Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and
points out
Django.
Page 100/184
90
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten
up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.
EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live
in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and
bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his
SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a
SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans,
and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.
THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much
the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the
Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his
Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the
Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray
farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the
wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it
Page 101/184
creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
ï¿ó. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the
porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.
Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang,
out.
steps...
STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald
pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a
character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the
Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers,
evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and
manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a
tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud
approach.
THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY
and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the
horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green
jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with
a,
Page 102/184
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do
you do;
CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!
STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?
STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?
DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.
:
DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.
STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.
CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.
STEPHEN
This nigger, here?
CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst
the
Page 103/184
blacks at Candyland.
STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?
CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?
STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -
CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?
STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.
CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
93
STEPHEN
(POINTING AT
DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?
CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.
STEPHEN
(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?
CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?
STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!
CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
Page 104/184
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;
STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA,
comes up
to her brother on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.
LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.
CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.
LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?
CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
Page 105/184
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older
one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE
BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and
Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;
CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django
and
Schultz.
CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.
(TO SCHULTZ
AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.
915
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.
CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.
(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Page 106/184
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.
ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces
at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.
ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.
ACE WOODY
How many you get?
(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.
CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.
ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?
CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;
MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.
ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away
into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals,
Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.
ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Page 107/184
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;
CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?
ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?
ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.
ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?
CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?
ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.
77
CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.
ACE WOODY
(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?
MOGUY
Yes I did.
ACE WOODY
Why?
MOGUY
I like his prospects.
ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
Page 108/184
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?
MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.
ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?
MOGUY
I did.
ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.
ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;
SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.
ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and
SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his
bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his
misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.
ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?
CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.
ACE WOODY
(POINTING AT
FRED)
This one over here?
Page 109/184
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.
BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?
CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.
'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?
CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.
99
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
Really? You won?
BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?
CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
Really?
CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
Page 110/184
You did?
BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.
ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?
BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the
back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?
ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos
1 00
ACE WOODY
(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.
ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.
(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;
CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Page 111/184
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;
ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.
CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?
STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.
CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.
(TO SCHULTZ
AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.
/O+
CALVIN CANDLE
(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named
TIMMY.
CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.
DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.
TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the
Page 112/184
boy.
DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.
DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?
CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?
,oz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?
CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.
(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.
STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.
CALVIN CANDIE
What?
STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?
Page 113/184
STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.
CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?
STEPHEN
She ran away again.
CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?
STEPHEN
Two.
CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?
STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.
CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they
sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.
STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.
CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?
STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.
CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.
STEPHEN
(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!
Page 114/184
CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.
STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?
CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and
LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box.
While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and
whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and
the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like
iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.
WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the
NAKED
Page 115/184
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.
REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.
STEPHEN
(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen
and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.
INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping
staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the
guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz
enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to
the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.
INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a
flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table
with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.
105
STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers
out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.
STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Page 116/184
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.
DJANGO
Not so fast.
STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.
DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.
DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?
STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING
STEPHEN
(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?
DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.
)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.
DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.
DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;
DJANGO
Page 117/184
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as
soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on
the
floor below his knees.
DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.
X07
STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.
DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.
DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,
Page 118/184
DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens,
and
Schultz stands there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.
DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.
INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed
in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's
door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.
DOG
LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.
BROOMHILDA
(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.
Page 119/184
(IN GERMAN)
Please come inside Fraulein.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara
looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.
INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.
Dr.SCHULTZ
They call you Hildi, but your real name
is Broomhilda, isn't it?
BROOMHILDA
Yes. How do you know that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Broomhilda?
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in
awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming
influence
on the frightened girl.
107
WE CUT TO DJANGO
on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for
his cue
to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he
begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ
(GERMAN)
I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
Page 120/184
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?
Dr.SCHULTZ
(GERMAN)
Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(.GERMAN).
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
forever.
BROOMHILDA
(GERMAN)
I don't got any friends.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(GERMAN)
Yes you do.
BROOMHILDA
(GERMAN)
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
(GERMAN)
I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
surprise you.
!!0
BROOMHILDA
(GERMAN)
Where is he?
He points at the adjoining door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(GERMAN)
Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Page 121/184
(GERMAN)
Promise me you won't scream?
She nods her head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(GERMAN)
Say, I promise.
BROOMHILDA
(GERMAN)
I promise.
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing...
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned
up.
He smiles at her, and says;
DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over,
and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead.
faint.
1/1
The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You silver tongued devil you.
MONTAGE
WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain
whatthey're
doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their
plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on
the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
vaguely optimistic ...
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
Page 122/184
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling
tune
continues over this scene.
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and
Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney
feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.
DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and
forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.
STEPHEN
What you. whistlin', girl?
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's
direction.
STEPHEN
What was you whistlin'?
BROOMHILDA
Oh nuttin'.
STEPHEN
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?
BROOMHILDA
I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
no.name.
)/Z
STEPHEN
It's kinder pretty.
She doesn't say anything in return.
STEPHEN
That was a compliment.
BROOMHILDA
Thank you.
Page 123/184
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to
Broomhilda.
STEPHEN
I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
.I'm jus' sayin'.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.
BROOMHILDA
I'm done here, may I be excused?
STEPHEN
Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.
INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people
(Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner
table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her
Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges,
the
Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver,
even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.
"5.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
Page 124/184
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
called Eskimo Joe?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
see why, he's a champion.
CALVIN CANDIE
All three are champions.
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;
DJANGO
Samson's the champion. The other two
are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing
Django
contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django
says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's
mashed
potatoes.
LARA LEE
Hildi!
Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that
analysis,
then issues his own appraisal;
CALVIN CANDIE
Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.
DJANGO
Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.
//
Page 125/184
F
Dr.SCHULTZ
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by
taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;
CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
appreciates the value of showmanship
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.
(BEAT)
A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.
CALVIN CANDIE
I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
Dr.SCHULTZ
.Famously.
(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
Page 126/184
it's like not to hear you native tongue
for four years.
CALVIN CANDIE
Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
Â»5
Everybody at the table chuckles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee
notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur
Candie.
LARA LEE
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all
three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.
AND ...
.STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for
the
kitchen.
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie
his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's
benefit.
CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.
STEPHEN
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
a COLD drink.
Page 127/184
Chuckle... . chuckle...
CALVIN CANDIE
Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston
STEPHEN
(MOCK INDIGNANT)
You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.
1/6
CALVIN CANDIE
What does that hafta do with the price of
Tea in China?
STEPHEN
You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
Chuckle... . chuckle...
CALVIN CANDIE
(MOCK INDIGNATION)
What? They laughed!
STEPHEN
Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
Chuckle... .chuckle...
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.
CALVIN CANDIE
No it was really funny,
(TO TABLE)
wasn't it?
STEPHEN
Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
embarrassing your guest.
(TO TABLE)
Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
it just encourages him.
Page 128/184
Chuckle-chuckle...
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.
TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he
locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.
STEPHEN
You know that nigger?
/ï¿ó She spins around.
11 7
BROOMHILDAÂ€¢
Who?
STEPHEN
Don't stall me bitch, you know who?
BROOMHILDA
At the table? I don't know him.
STEPHEN.
You don't know him?
BROOMHILDA
No.
STEPHEN
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
She shakes her head, no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.
STEPHEN
Okay, if you say so.
BACK TO DINNER TABLE
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.
DJANGO
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
for him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What would your price be?
DJANGO
Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
Candie's lawyer chimes in.
Page 129/184
MOGUY
But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django?
DJANGO
In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...
(CON'T)
11Y
DJANGO
(CON'T)
Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
one thousand dollars.
CALVIN CANDIE
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and
says;
Page 130/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.Schultz continues;
Dr.SCHULTZ
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
comfortable exchanging that amount of
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
the finer points between themselves.
117
CALVIN CANDIE
Splendid.
(CALLING TO
THE KITCHEN)
Stephen, time for dessert!
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of
the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.
BROOMHILDA
Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may, Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.
CALVIN CANDIE
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
table in the big house?
BROOMHILDA
I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.
CALVIN CANDIE
Page 131/184
It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
bramble bush, ain't it?
BROOMHILDA
Yes 'em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.
STEPHEN
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
where he from.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO SCHULTZ)
When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
clothes off?
!20
Dr.SCHULTZ
We just spoke.
CALVIN CANDIE
So you haven't seen her back?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No I haven't.
CALVIN CANDIE
Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.
LARA LEE
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.
CALVIN CANDIE
But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
Page 132/184
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.
LARA LEE
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.
CALVIN CANDIE
Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back
into the
kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda
behind
the kitchen door.
121
INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to
Broomhilda;
STEPHEN
I thought you said you didn't know him?
Broomhilda turns around.
BROOMHILDA
Huh?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.
STEPHEN
I said, you said, you didn't know him?
BROOMHILDA
I don't.
STEPHEN
Yes you do.
BROOMHILDA
Mister Stephen, I don't.
STEPHEN
Why you lyin to me?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.
Page 133/184
BROOMBILDA
I ain't.
STEPHEN
Why you cryin'?
BROOMHILDA
Because you're scarin' me.
STEPHEN
Why am I scarin' you?
BROOMHILDA
Because you're scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the
dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
.to speak German,with Hildi this
afternoon was positively soul enriching.
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.
1ZL
His eyes to to Broomhilda.
STEPHEN
You, stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen
knows
these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and
now he's
just figured it out.
INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ
You indicated earlier you would be
willing to part with Hildi?
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob I did.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case allow me to propose
another proposition?
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.
STEPHEN
Page 134/184
- Monsieur Candie?
CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.
STEPHEN
(to Dr.Schultz)
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.
(TO CANDIE)
Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
the kitchen.
CALVIN CANDIE
What, you mean get outta my chair?
STEPHEN
If you could manage it. It's about dessert.
CALVIN CANDIE
What about dessert?
STEPHEN
I would rather tell you in private.
CALVIN CANDIE
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?
123
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;
STEPHEN
Meet me in the library.
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever
Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in
the
library" is their secret signal.
CALVIN CANDIE
Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
time, adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.
Page 135/184
TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit
mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the
globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the
red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair,
drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room,
Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane.
Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can
talk
turkey.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's the matter?
STEPHEN
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -
CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell you talkin' about?
STEPHEN
They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
that girl.
CALVIN CANDIE
What girl, Hildi?
STEPHEN
Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.
CALVIN CANDIE
He just bought Eskimo Joe.
STEPHEN
Did he give you any money?
CALVIN CANDIE
Page 136/184
Well not yet, but -
STEPHEN
- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.
CALVIN CANDIE
Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
five hundred dollars?
STEPHEN
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.
CALVIN CANDIE
If she's who they want, why the whole
snake oil pitch about mandingos?
STEPHEN
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
thousand got you real friendly.
Calvin thinks ...
.as per usual, Stephen's right.
CALVIN CANDIE
Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
sonsabitches!
(LOUDER)
Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
feathering!

STEPHEN
Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.
CALVIN CANDLE
Page 137/184
I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
huckster insinuate themselves at my
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
plantation for a fool!
STEPHEN
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
discuss this.
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.
STEPHEN
Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
changed is the advantage.
(BEAT)
Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
and busts these motherfucker's chops.
INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold
court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room
from the
kitchen door.
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts
out upon
SEEING HIM;
LARA LEE
There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as
he
stares down the table at them.
CALVIN CANDLE
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
Lara Lee?

Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz
and
Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
your shoulder?
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off
shotgun
pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his
hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.
(BEAT)
Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Mr.Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
Page 139/184
Dr.SCHULTZ
Right.
CALVIN CANDIE
(YELLING TO
STEPHEN)
Stephen! Bring out Hildi!
Ix?
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer
pistol
against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
horseshit.
(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
silently watch Candie's next move.
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
thousand dollars."
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
Page 140/184
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.
CALVIN CANDIE
Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
everybody jump.
IN
CALVIN CANDIE
And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.
CALVIN CANDIE
Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I lift my hands from the table top in
order to remove my billfold?
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may.
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray
suit
jacket, and says;,
Dr.SCHULTZ
Easy come, easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation
owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the
table at
the seated Schultz, and says;
CALVIN CANDIE
Pleasure doin' business with you.
Page 141/184
TIME CUT
INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
.Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
freedom papers.
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody,
and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is
a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
dollars- for twelve thousand.
Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and
buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate
of
rhubarb pie with him.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO SCHULTZ)
Rhubarb pie?
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
Dr.SCHULTZ
No.
CALVIN CANDIE
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
of ya?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs.
Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
Page 142/184
examines he papers.
CALVIN CANDIE
Dumas...?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?
CALVIN CANDIE
You doubt he'd approve?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
at best.
CALVIN CANDIE
Soft hearted Frenchy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas is black.
1 30
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his
two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
We got it, let's go.
(TO CANDIE)
Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;
CALVIN CANDIE
One more moment, Doc!
Dr.SCHULTZ
What?
CALVIN CANDIE
It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
Page 143/184
faith.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not from the South.
He turns to leave.
CALVIN CANDIE
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.
CALVIN CANDIE
You know what I think you are?
Dr.SCHULTZ
What you think I am? No I don't.
1310,
CALVIN CANDLE
I think you are a bad loser.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And I think you're an abysmal winner.
CALVIN CANDLE
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
away twelve thousand dollars...?
I don't think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let's go.
CALVIN CANDIE
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Cut 'er down.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye,
Page 144/184
asks
CANDLE;
Dr.SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand?
Django gets it.
CALVIN CANDIE
I insist.
DR
-Schultz smiles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, if you insist.
Django goes to stop him...
1 714
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...
POP!
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and
he
falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO DJANGO)
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.
FADE TO BLACK
We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the
ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his
wrists
Page 145/184
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down
his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just
about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.
INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's
face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...
TIMMY
(SHHH'S HIM)
Act like you still sleepin'.
DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?
TIMMY
Who?
DJANGO
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
Hot Box.
TIMMY
I don't know 'bout no girl.
DJANGO
How 'bout that German white man I came
here with?
TIMMY
Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight
of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and
anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an
empty
bucket at the fleeing boy.
ACE WOODY
Git on outta here, boy!
133
Page 146/184
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside
down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie,
which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.
ACE WOODY
So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
Django thinks, "How does he know?"
ACE WOODY
I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
line of work?
Django retorts, upside down.
DJANGO
Well, it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.
ACE WOODY
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a
body
length from the hanging man.
ACE WOODY
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
everyone 'round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he
wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE
ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.
ACE WOODY
Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Django's face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly
walks
Page 147/184
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade
out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;
ACE WOODY
Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again...
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says;
ACE WOODY
Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
methods are, tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again...
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out
of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging
upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
mercy.
ACE WOODY
You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
Page 148/184
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.
(BEAT)
Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
mandingos as her brother?
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.
IJS
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes
his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut
sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing
pole.
ACE WOODY
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
Django dances some more ...
ACE WOODY
Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.
(BREATH)
On the count of three.
DJANGO SCREAMS:
DJANGO
NO!!!!
ACE WOODY
ONE ...
DJANGO
NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!
ACE WOODY
Got to do it, boy. TWO...
DJANGO
NO!!!! !
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his
Page 149/184
arm.
STEPHEN
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;
ACE WOODY
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted
emotion
of what almost happened.
ACE WOODY
(TO DJANGO)
How disappointing.
171
ACE WOODY
(TO STEPHEN)
Where she at?
STEPHEN
She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in
the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried
in
the fire.
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.
ACE WOODY
You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;
STEPHEN
Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED
HOT END
GLOWS ORANGE.
STEPHEN
Page 150/184
Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down
Django,
alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
hanging Django.
STEPHEN
I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.
(BREATH)
That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
Big House.
137
STEPHEN
(BEAT)
And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture
silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he
screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the
orange
tip of that red hot poker.
STEPHEN
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
Page 151/184
you are, you always know the end is near
'fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show
of
breathing it in his nostrils.
STEPHEN
Damn Nigger, you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.
STEPHEN
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that, Bright Boy?
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's
BARE
buttocks.
Django SCREAMS!
Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses
them on
the floor by the hanging man.
STEPHEN
You leavin', that's what you can take
with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he
talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.
I31
STEPHEN
Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
Page 152/184
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
worse then that."
He stops massaging Django's balls.
STEPHEN
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
I give two or three.
Stephen turns to leave.
DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?
STEPHEN
She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.
CUT TO
137
EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes
riding
Page 153/184
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from
a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the
wagon, a
2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a
white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses
ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents,
have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.
ROY
It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
git out.
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney,
Chicken
Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy
Giles.
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry
the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville.
Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.
FLOYD
You blacks line up.
They do.
FLOYD
What's your names?
CHESTER
Chester.
CHICKEN CHARLY
Chicken Charly.
RODNEY
Rodney.
FLOYD
I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.
(POINTING AT
CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
What's that?
CHESTER
It's my stuff.
Page 154/184
FLOYD
Throw it in the dirt.
1 40
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes
the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the
dirt.
FLOYD
(to Chicken Charly)
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
(to all three)
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb
into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we
hear Ace
Woody call out;
ACE WOODY (OS)
Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless
and
barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story),
wearing his
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.
ROY
We can't use that skinny bastard.
ACE WOODY
We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.
ROY
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.
ACE WOODY
Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.
ROY
Look, no one tole' me 'bout -
Page 155/184
ACE WOODY
- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
hush up about it!
ROY
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.
"H
Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
Django stops Ace Woody.
DJANGO
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocksshit
y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.
ACE WOODY
He can't go in there with them.
FLOYD
Why not?
ACE WOODY
They'll kill him.
FLOYD
I don't give a damn.
ACE WOODY
Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!
ROY
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.
JANO
Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the
Page 156/184
other end
around his saddle horn.
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.
EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw
County.
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon,
Rodney,
Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage
wagon, Jano
riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.
J42
DJANGO
(TO JANO)
Hey boy!
Jano ignores him.
DJANGO
I said, hey white boy!
JANO
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.
DJANGO
What's he pay you?
JANO
Who?
DJANGO
LeQuint Dickey?
JANO
You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.
DJANGO
I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
Mining Company, ain't I?
JANO
Yeah.
DJANGO
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, dont'cha?
JANO
Page 157/184
Yeah?
DJANGO
Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
for today?
JANO
Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.
I"
DJANGO
How long you been here?
JANO
'bout two years.
DJANGO
And you ain't paid him back yet?
JANO
(DEFENSIVELY)
No, not yet!
DJANGO
(LAUGHS)
You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...
JANO
(YELLING)
You shut up!
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;
DJANGO
How'd you like to make eleven thousand
dollars?
JANO
What?
Django steps closer to him.
DJANGO
How would you like to make eleven thousand
Page 158/184
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
actually?
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;
ROY
Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
and keep up!
DJANGO
Keep riding, just ride slower.
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.
R44
DJANGO
Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
right past it.
JANO
You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.
DJANGO
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
earn it.
JANO
If you got something to say, say it.
DJANGO
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.
JANO
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.
Page 159/184
(BEAT)
But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
mates could get that money.
JANO
Who pays the money?
DJANGO
The Court.
JANO
The Court?
DJANGO
The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
back, from up on a hill, in the back of
the head, in their sleep - don't matter.
(CON'T)
DJANGO
(CON'T)
Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
long as you do it.
JANO
They.pay us to kill 'em?
DJANGO
No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
corpse. Get it?
JANO
I think so... . what did these jokers do again?
DJANGO
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good
luck.
He hands it to Jano.
JANO
What's this?
DJANGO
I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
Jano looks at the handbill.
Page 160/184
DJANGO
Whatsamatter, can't you read?
JANO
I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.
DJANGO
What about that cowboy fella in the lead?
JANO
Roy?
DJANGO
Can Roy read?
JANO
Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
read. I just don't got my glasses.

EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled
over to
the side of the road.
IN THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch
through
the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension
of
what they're watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian
mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they
can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three
men a
piece of paper.
INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.
DJANGO
I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Page 161/184
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.
(TO ROY)
You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
and gittin it.
Django is damn convincing.
ROY
What's your deal? You tell us who they are
and we let ya go?
DJANGO
I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just
needs
one little push.
1Q7
DJANGO
Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?
CUT TO
ROY AND FLOYD
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they
Page 162/184
walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.
ROY
(READING ALOUD)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.
FLOYD
Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.
ROY
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.
ROY
That black's damn convincing.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct
question;
ROY
(pointing, behind
him, at Django)
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and
points
the barrel at the cage.
ROY
I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?
CHESTER
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
white man.
ROY
This white man, was the black his slave?
RODNEY
He weren't no slave.
Page 163/184
FLOYD
You sure about that?
RODNEY
Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar
windfall
seriously.
ROY
What happened at Candyland?
CHICKEN CHARLY
Bunch of shootin, master got shot.
ROY
Who shot 'em?
CHICKEN CHARLY
The German.
ROY
And why did he do that?
CHICKEN CHARLY
The nigger and the German were actin as if they
were slavers, but they weren't.
ROY
What were they?
RODNEY
Bounty hunters.
Floyd is starting to get convinced.
FLOYD
Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
(to the Slaves)
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?
!Y,
ROY
(barking at Floyd)
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
you idiot!
CUT TO
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.
ROY
Okay black, you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.
DJANGO
Page 164/184
I got one more condition.
ROY
What?
DJANGO
When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's
wrists.
ROY
(LAUGHING)
You got a deal, black.
Django interrupts -
DJANGO
You gotta deal, mate.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two
Aussies.
ROY
You're all right for a black fella!
THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white
men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as
them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"
BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET
ROY
We'll give you that pack horse.
DJANGO
What's them saddle bags filled with?
FLOYD
Dynamite.
!so
DJANGO
I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
dynamite on his back!
ROY
(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
cage.
Page 165/184
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with
dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the
cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't
like this
at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from
Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to
The
Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;
DJANGO
Where's my pistol?
ROY
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks
over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;
FLOYD
Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
fixed last month, it's perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.
DJANGO
That's good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD
TWICE
in the chest...
Roy turns around...
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's
shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!
Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
Page 166/184
The CAGE WAGON
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of
the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and
SMOKE in
the air, obscuring all visibility...
THEN ...
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust
away,
REVEALING in bright color focus...
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left
of
Jano.
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company
beast,
and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon
seat
next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new
rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of
horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...
.THEN...
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on
the
cage door.
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;
DJANGO
Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to
Django on
his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around,
and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of
Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.

A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN
from
the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession
of
Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the
hill on
'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black
dress,
wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy
(Cora)
crying at her side.
CORA
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
Candie think it real nice.
LARA LEE
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.
WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in
one
hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass
against a
gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.
EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
-Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions
share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire
kennel
next to the bunkhouse.
INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the
Page 168/184
bunkhouse
wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get
rid of
your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER
EARS"
(yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may
notice
that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

MARSHA
rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her
three
PALS continue to lay out.
DJANGO BY A TREE
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in
the
chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.
MARSHA
BARK!
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
Django disappears.
INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
They hear the barking inside.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Jake!
Jake building his birdhouse.
JAKE
Page 169/184
Yeah?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Check on Marsha.
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and
rises to
check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).
EXT - TRACKER SHACK
As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.
JAKE
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front
of
him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...
DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...
JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.
After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward
Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening,
Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S
FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three
trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and
Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE,
and is
able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great
with a
knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack
attack
attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless
Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then
it's
just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save
Page 170/184
Broomhilda,
not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers,
he has
to take Stonesipher's ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's
domination
all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs,
fight
each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but
the
mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around
his
opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was
building
the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF
STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for
good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads
some
words over him.
EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders,
steps
out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and
walks
over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says
Page 171/184
outloud;
DJANGO
What ya doin around here, boy?
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.
TIMMY
I was just walkin' by.
DJANGO
Wanna help me out?
TIMMY
Sure.
DJANGO
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is?
TIMMY
Sure do.
DJANGO
You show me?
TIMMY
Will I get in trouble?
DJANGO
Not by the time I get through killin'
everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes
him.
TIMMY
I'll show ya.
THEN ...
Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and
asks;
DJANGO
You know what toadstools look like?
15-C
TIMMY
Sure do.
DJANGO
Go pick me a mess of 'em.
INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden
spoon in
the tracker shack.
Page 172/184
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and
CHOPS
the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce,
and
mixes it up with the spoon.
EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the
kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf
up
the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.
DJANGO
You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.
DJANGO
First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.
EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.
TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds.
Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's
happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for
him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.
DJANGO
Saddle up Fritz and Tony.
Timmy just stares.
DJANGO
Now, boy!
Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes
Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
Page 173/184
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in
a
holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;
TIMMY
Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.
DJANGO
Yeah, "I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;
TIMMY
I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a
white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare
chest.
And finally his hat.

BROOMHILDA
I can't help it! I'm really sad!
He hops off her and yells at her.
BILLY CRASH
Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
for niggers! Git use to it!
(CALMING DOWN)
Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
from way back. But you know I've always been
sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries
for
Django, she cries for herself...
.THEN...
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in
Billy
Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move
towards the
front door.
CU BROOMHILDA
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.
BROOMHILDA

No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
and get out of the south.
BROOMHILDA
What's gonna happen to you?
DJANGO
Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,

BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips)
both

and finally,
SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos,
wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew..
This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post
funeral
drinks.
They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the
front
door.
Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side
of the
property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all
dressed in
their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big
House.
The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't
Page 177/184
looking
their way.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
moves closer towards the front of The Big House...
WHEN ...
The front of The Big House
EXPLODES!
knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
can't believe their eyes.
I6 I
WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
hang in the air.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even
seriously
hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes
look
up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke
the
mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps
remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards
them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees
it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
.it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
Page 178/184
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his
DJANGO
OUTFIT.
STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe
Django's
standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking
down
at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn,
Winchester
rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held
casually by
the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture
of
Wonder, Fear, and Hate.
ICZ
WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The
Big
House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says;
DJANGO
I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?
ACE WOODY
I guess I shoulda'.
DJANGO
Yes you should of.
He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.
DJANGO
Everybody stand up!
It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.
THEN...
Page 179/184
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he
takes a
SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House
steps
at the ten people, and says;
DJANGO
All black folks, take ten steps away from
the white folks.
DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.
DJANGO
Not you Stephen. You're right where you
belong.
163
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin
taking ten
steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that
nigger."
DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out
of
his pocket.
DJANGO
(TO STEPHEN)
Let's see if you can handle this as well
as you can my nuts?
He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.
DJANGO
(TO EVERYBODY)
Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.
BROWN
(TO DJANGO)
Can I at least cock it for her?
DJANGO
Yep.
Page 180/184
BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her
hand,
and points it towards the ground.
BROWN
(to Lara Lee)
Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till

fast as you can.
LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in
the
middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about
to
happen.
DJANGO

EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...
TILL...
ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN
starts
to raise his Derringer.
But it's no contest.
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his
left hand
FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White
People (and
Stephen) standing in front of him.
They all fall to grass in different ways..
It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't

know
HOW GOOD DJANGO was.
FLASH ON
DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE
MARKSMANSHIP
to Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(SMILING)
You know what they're going to call you,

BACK TO SHOWDOWN
DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House,
looking
down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
Candyland front lawn.
The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.
/65
All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are
still
alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE
STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to
mention,
blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling
tremendous
satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and
Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;
DJANGO
Page 182/184
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
BROOMHILDA
Hey Big Trouble Maker.
DJANGO
Down, boy.
Timmy hops off of Tony.
Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;
DJANGO

to me.
BROOMHILDA
Yes you did.
DJANGO
Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.
BROOMHILDA

Â–º66
Django looks down to Timmy.
DJANGO
Thanks for the help, boy.
He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and
tosses it
down to Timmy.
DJANGO
That's for you. Good luck Tim.
(he points to
the Northern Sky)
The North star, is that one.
He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.
DJANGO
You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?
BROOMHILDA
You won't wait for me.
DJANGO
Better not.
BROOMHILDA
You won't.
DJANGO
(SMILING)
Better not.

BROOMHILDA
(SMILING)

They kiss.
Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
Dragons.
